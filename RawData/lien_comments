######## BRUITS ##########
1. I normally can't stand the smell but...
2. With some makeup I can't stand the smell but with.. love the smell
3. I can't stand the scent of orange, and I absolutely love the xxx Orange Blossom

######## NOTES ############
1. checked odeur neg corpus first 200 comments, "dosen't smell" has a great percentage of error. Most are positive.
2. "doesn't smell great doesn't smell bad either", probably neutre?
