It's very light on the skin, you can't feel it after you put some on. Nearly fragrance-free, though I've caught a whiff of a citrusy smell when I sniffed the cream up-close, but I could just be imagining the scent too.

I love the consistency of the cleanser; it's very thick but when you massage it with your wet fingers it turns into thick foam and it feels (and smells) very refreshing on your face. A little goes a long way, too. My pores look much better and much cleaner after using it, and I've noticed they look much better than they used to before I started using this product. I've even had people notice and comment on how good my skin looks! It's great at controlling my oily T-zone without drying out my skin, either, which is fantastic because I have extremely combination skin!I'm so happy I purchased this cleanser, I love it so much, and I'll definitely buy it again! :)"

It brightened up my eyes instantly! My under eye area was glowing! I wish I could put it on my entire face! Tarte should really come out with an all over face cream that delivers the same effect! Totally obsessed! A little goes a long way so this will last quite awhile but I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out. It didnt burn my eyes or smell bad like other eye creams I've tried. I highly recommend! Hope this review has helped. =)"
