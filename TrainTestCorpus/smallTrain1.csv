5	10955842	"Received as a gift w a Gucci bag for quitting smoking from my parents. This is my first bottle. It smells divine but it is so expensive shame I can't afford to replace it otherwise it would've been my signature scent. My signature scent is charlotte Tilbury scent of a dream. I don't like smelling like a lot of other females out there & it's similar to Dolce both are fleurotic new style green chypres. Don't send death threats to me for comparing them I know Scent of a Dream takes a quirky wearer & dolce is white t/jeans/converse easy elegance in a bottle. My mom (direct quote: ""ALL perfumes smell like DIRT!"") was living dangerously picking a fragrance for me but she did an excellent job. My mom picks dolce my daddy gifted me Giorgio Armani Si my parents got good taste! Dolce opens w white flowers & damp earth then morphs into this loveliness, classic floral elegance w lasting power floral never over bearing nor obnoxious nor screechy loud it sits there sweetly purely. I'm horrible at describing frags so don't take my word for it go to a Dept store or sephora & douse yourself. Don't go for a white placard w the scent u need to see how it smells on YOU ur chemistry etc. take their white sprayed card & stick in your bag so the insides will smell like Dolce!! Xx"	positif

49	17805827	A pretty, cheery and subtle floral. Slightly sweet but shows good taste. Light, nothing heavy here. Cute, clean and fun. If lightly applied it sits close to the skin and indeed becomes a good, somewhat sexy skin scent for a woman.	positif
50	4802477	This is a lovely and feminine scent, a light and fruity floral scent which is perfect for day wear. I really enjoy the scent of the musk coming through and blending with the light jasmine. This is absolutely a fragrance that I enjoy from early morning to afternoon, it makes me feel nice and refreshed! I could also see using this fragrance on a date night to the movies or maybe for a nice evening walk, I really enjoy the Ralph Lauren Tender Romance Scent. This perfume is a delightful addition to my scent collection! I received this perfume as a free sample and tested the scent, all opinions expressed were my own of course. It smells amazing!	positif
51	18012744	This is my number one go to fragrance when I want a light sexy perfume. I have been using this perfume for 10 plus years. It has a light floral scent that despite it having such a light scent lasts all week basically, as I can still smell it when I do my laundry. I highly recommend this perfume to anyone looking for a sheer yet fragrant scent that’s long lasting	positif
52	10516010	This floral fragrance is good for everyday use. It smells good. I like it scent, but this's not something that I would get for myself. I don't really like it that much because it's just another mixed floral scent perfume. There's no standing scent. It like the whole garden walking around. It smell like when many women wore floral perfume walking together.	positif
53	23976722	This fragrance is very sweet. It smells like a dessert. You know that scent when you first walk into bakery or patisserie and you are holding freshly baked pastries. That's it exactly. I love the scent profile overall but I wish it was a little bit stronger and more long lasting. I think the body cream actually holds the scent a bit better than the actual perfume oddly enough. 	positif
54	14302411	This perfume has a very light, subtle scent that lasts all day. I've found it wonderful for days when I'm at work because I don't really catch the scent constantly. Every so often I'll catch the scent and feel a little happy. The smell lasted all day, which was surprising to me because of how light of a fragrance it is.	positif
55	18075013	I've received this product along with it's sister scent Sinner for free from Influenster. I've tried both and have been absolutely charmed by the Saint scent. Saint plays on sweet and musky notes to combine a classy and elegant scent. The fragrance smells very feminine and lasts all day. I would definitely recommend this perfume to anyone who prefers more earthy, floral and slightly sweet scents.	positif
56	7821109	Such a good fragrance. It has a beautiful clean scent to it without it smelling like old lady perfume. I like how it's not a strong scent but it is a lingering scent. It mixes well with different body smells and works well with different shampoos and lotions as well. It has a very refreshing clean laundry type of smell.	positif

65	17763664	I really love this fragrance its perfect for daytime/ office as it's very light and not over powering. Its smells wonderful, it has that really nice fresh scent. However don't expect it to last all day because the scent does linger away it is after all an edt. TOP TIP for the scent to last is to apply it to your wrist, behind the knees and neck, inner elbows and this will help the perfume react to your body heat and continuously release the scent so it lasts all day. I	positif
66	10534042	I loved the scent, loved the fragrance , I recommend the perfume for those who like a mixture of sweet smell and slightly citric .	positif
67	18949778	Very exotic scent. It seems strong at first, but it has a very unique smell that lingers all day. I always get compliments in the scent. I wouldn't recommend the scent for people under 25, because it seems to have a more mature fragrance. It resembles department store fragrances that sell for a much higher price. A lovely scent. The lotion is strong enough to wear without perfume, but will last all day if you layer :)	positif

71	11580236	Smells good taste good. Softens and moisturizes lips. Although I appreciate the metal container as opposed to plastic, I wish it in a tube, not a tin .

89	11569791	It might not have a good taste or smell awesome, but I feel like this chapstick actually helps my lips. It goes on really smooth and helps my lips feel nice and moist throughout the day. I also like that it's more of a liquid than a balm.	positif

94	23029459	"LOVE. THIS. STUFF. I'm addicted to perfume, and probably own at least 15 different full size bottles and dozens and dozens of sample vials. For reference, some of my favorites are Fracas by Robert Piguet, Lillia Bella by Guerlain (which has sadly been discontinued), Dahlia and Vines by NEST, Love Story by Chloe, L'eau Bleue by Miu Miu, and Coco by Chanel (the original, NOT Madamoiselle), which up until now had been my signature scent. But when I got a vial of Gabrielle in a Play box, I knew I had found the scent that I had been searching for since the very beginning. This stuff is marvelous! It is striking yet subtle, unique yet familiar, complex but not complicated, and light but without seeming trivial. I think it this scent could work for just about everyone, but it seems especially well suited for someone in my age group (26-35). It is delicate, flowery, and clean, but also slightly woodsy/spicy, which anchors the scent and gives it a more mature (read ""grownup"" NOT ""old"") edge. This perfume conveys confidence, wisdom, beauty, and good taste. If my house were on fire, this is the one perfume I would save out of the entire collection. The bottle looks lovely amongst all the others on my tray, and I'm so very happy that I crossed paths with this wonderful perfume! It is my new signature scent, and I can't recommend it highly enough!"	positif
95	7839553	My current favorite perfume! It's pricey, but so worth it. The scent lasts for so long and you don't need to spritz thousand times in order smell like a goddess. The bottle is gorgeous, the scent is seductive and it's not just a night fragrance. Expect compliments when wearing this one!	positif
96	19943313	This perfume lasts all day and smells wonderful. Compared to other high end fragrances, this scent is strong and does not fade. The bottle is decorated nicely with a cute bow. The price is a little steep but the scent makes it worth it.	positif
97	17316023	My favorite perfume. This is a great fragrance because it lasts all day long even if you can't smell it on yourself. The scent is full bodied. Fresh and citrusy with light woody smells to ground the scent. The cologne is also very intoxicating, and addictive. It smells like money	positif
98	19628151	love Beautiful fragrance. I got this scent in the perfume and in the lotion and both smell absolutely stunning. It doesn't last strongly all day, it fades to a softer quieter scent that sticks to your skin, especially if you put this on right after a shower.	positif

103	12417430	This is my favorite fragrance from Bath & Body Works. It smells so amazing! It definitely smells like citrus and a bit floral. To me it has a fresh scent type of smell. The fragrance mist is a nice buy, but I would recommend getting the perfume since the scent lasts longer on the skin.	positif
104	4762997	This is my favorite Marc Jacobs fragrance. It doesn't have a strong floral scent, which I hate and why I don't really like Marc Jacobs perfumes. The floral scent is really subtle. And according to my co-workers it smells like maple bars.	positif
105	1153178	Beautiful fragrance. I got this scent in the perfume and in the lotion and both smell absolutely stunning. It doesn't last strongly all day, it fades to a softer quieter scent that sticks to your skin, especially if you put this on right after a shower.	positif

107	15129827	Poeme by Lancôme is a very classic smelling scent - warm notes create a sensual feeling to this fragrance. Ideal perfume for Autumn and Winter months as it is more of a heavy scent. I love this as an alternative to Chanel No.5.	positif

116	10909380	It is soooo hard for me to find this fragrance and my mom and I love the scent. She had been wearing Thai perfume since I was a child and the scent lasts all day. This is one of the best scents Versace has every cake out with and it has such a distinct smell!	positif
117	15600252	Nice fresh scent. Good size. Fragrance lasts all day. Very subtle but smells Devine. Compared to something like juicy couture it has a much fresher scent and it's not as intense. Simple bottle but the colour of the perfume looks great through the bottle. 	positif
118	14300331	This is my absolutely favorite perfume! It can be used as a daytime scent as well as a nighttime scent. It is not over powering and just the right amount of fragrance. It is a great fragrance for any age and doesn't make you smell like a middle schooler. I would definitely recommend it!	positif
119	10544264	Honestly, this is one of the best perfume fragrances I've ever smelled. My aunt owned this, and she let me have it. The scent is not very long lasting, but it smells amazing. The scent will usually last 30 minutes or an hour.	positif
120	4793221	I love this lotion and gel scent from Fresh. The application is thick and smooth and the scent is really reminiscent of childhood! It also pairs very well with many different fragrances, so don't be too concerned about this lotion making your favorite perfume smell weird!	positif
121	19187096	This fragrance is a breath of fresh air. You smell amazing and it is just right. Not too strong and not to light. You smell clean and feel clean. The packing is perfect and the scent last all day. I would recommend this perfume to everyone would loves the floral but smooth scent. 	positif
122	12296622	I love this fragrance , one of my favorites ! The smell is a fresh scent , 'mNot too like strong where u instantly get fed up of it. Strong enought that someone can definetly know its your perfume :) freshhhh, smooth scent . You will definetly want to re buy .	positif
123	7820517	This is the first perfume I ever purchased for myself. Its scent is so distinct it brings back so many memories. I was constantly complemented when I wore this. The scent eventually seeped into my clothes and I could smell it all the time. Truly a wonderful fragrance and a great line.	positif
124	10538032	Great perfume! I have several Marc Jacobs fragrances, and this one is a really nice floral. The only downside is that it can be a bit strong smelling. I prefer perfumes that have a lighter scent like Marc Jacobs Dot. Would recommend if you want a more noticeable scent.	positif
125	1454149	This perfume has a lovely fresh scent which makes it an ideal daytime fragrance for the summer month. I do find that the scent doesn't last long on my skin but as an EDT, that's to be expected. I enjoy the smell of the fragrance but would not purchase again purely because it irritates my allergies.	positif
126	17080578	I love how fresh and clean this fragrance smells. Love the scent. It is a little pricey but the scent lasts a good amount of time. Love the simple packaging, Calvin Klein you did it again amazing perfume	positif
127	17904702	I wear this product as an everyday perfume and also a holiday fragrance. I find the scent lasts and doesn’t need regular top ups. I also thing is is value for money, for a branded product. It’s has a light, floral scent that does smell musty or dated like some.&nbsp;	positif
128	19048806	This smells good. it has a tea scent and it smells like sweet tea. Its perfect for everyday use. its fragrance stays for like 2 - 3 hours. Its my go to perfume. You can use this if you would just like to wear a simple yet elegant scent	positif
129	7831576	I love my bath and body works fragrant mist. I used these when I don't want to wear actual perfume. Not too strong. The scent that I have is the winter fragrances which is snowflakes and cashmere and frosted sparkling snowflakes. The smell is a very fresh and clean scent. Would definitely recommend these scents.	positif
130	16536591	This is a great perfume. I love all Marc Jacobs fragrances. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this scent It comes in a gorgeous bottle and It smells amazing. The scent is mild and subtle. Only complain I have is that the smell seems to go quickly	positif
131	22590916	This is my signature scent. I have only a few perfumes I use because my sinuses can’t handle strong perfumes or smells. The scent of this is absolutely amazing and it’s gentle yet I smell so good. Beautifully fragranced.	positif
132	22593049	This isn't my favorite Marc Jacobs by Marc Jacobs perfume/fragrance but I do like the scent. I prefer more flowery scents, but it is a nice scent for others who prefer something a bit more natural? Or musky? Smells lovely, lasts all day and has a good quantity	positif
133	14304766	This scent... SO GOOD. I literally bought this fragrance in every available form (lotion, shimmer must, perfume, body wash) because it made me smell fantastic. Highly recommend if you're looking for a new, unique, yet classic scent!	positif
134	17880944	This is more of a floral fresh scent. it smells amazing against my body chemistry I get a lot of compliments when I wear this fragrance I would definitely recommend it for those who love floral scent and will always as long as they continue to make it be in my perfume lineup.	positif
135	5064140	This is good stuff. It's citrusy when first applied, but the scent turns into a sparking floral as time went on. I don't know what people are talking about when they say it fades. The staying power was all day, it still carries the same richness as the original. The saucy girls with good taste will know :)	positif
136	16625778	"This is the best perfume ever! I swear I will not use any other perfume I've been using this scent for about 15 years I must have eight or nine empty bottles. People I know automatically link this perfume to ""my scent"" when you have strangers stop you and ask you what perfume are you wearing you know it's a great smelling fragrance. And seriously the scent does NOT fade. Will honestly be my forever favorite product to exist!"	positif
137	10540577	I received a sample of this scent complimentary of @Influenster and @VeraWangGang for reviewing purposes. This scent is very light and clean smelling so if you are sensitive to scents, you should definitely try this one out. The price is affordable compared to other fragrances and it reminds me of a luxury perfume. I cant wait until I finish this sample and I'm going to purchase a bigger bottle! I recommend this scent to anyone looking to try out a new fragrance. 	positif
138	4831281	This fragrance is loaded with earthy natural scents. The cardamom and bergamot is what I love. Most women's perfumes are too sweet smelling to me. I don't want to smell like a flower shop or bakery. I'd rather smell like dirt and musk and passion. This scent represents it all. A close second would be my previous scent; spice bomb by viktor & rolf. This is for anyone who is unique and wants a scent that defines them. Ladies don't be afraid to try men's cologne.	positif
139	4871781	good value, good for any occasion. Wow! I can't even explain how much I love this perfume. It's the perfect scent for any occasion. It's very floral so if you don't like strong floral scents, this isn't a good perfume for you. I love the layers of scent and I could even smell the subtle hints of bergamot and patchouli. This is a fabulous fragrance and Flowerbomb is my new go-to scent.	positif
140	15528958	I love everything Dior so of course this perfume would fit in perfectly with my fragrance and makeup collection. This perfume says that it is feminine, luxurious, and sensual, with notes of rose and jasmine. This perfume smells exactly as described. I can pinpoint the rose and jasmine scents as well. This is totally more of a seasonal scent for spring and summer. I really like the scent but I would say that I have definitely liked other perfumes a lot more than this one. This is not like a perfume I would make a signature scent for me personally. 	positif
141	10516310	"This is my daily perfume and my ""claimed personal scent"". I have been using this product for years now and it's my absolute favourite scent. It's a light, summery scent that is a classic. My mother always said that when wearing a good perfume others would be able to smell the fragrance, but you wouldn't continuously smell it whilst wearing it. For this perfume, it's true. I can't say enough good things about it."	positif
142	19623531	Pretty beachy summer fragrance Pretty spring/summer scent. Definitely get the coconut water and sun-screen notes with this perfume. The lasting power is decent (4-6hrs), but you'll probably want to pack the rollerball in your bag if you want to smell the scent all day. The scent doesn't have much of a throw, but it's still very pretty and I've gotten compliments on this fragrance.	positif
143	22700975	YES JUICY! FRAGRANCE DIVERSITY! I just got this as a sample and I'm in love! Not every woman is into florals & fruits as a scent! This is definitely for us earthy, woodsy scent gals. If you like smelling like juices & berries, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! Just like Tom Ford. I don't believe he makes perfumes for the average woman either. This scent is very comparable to his fragrances. Great job Juicy in being more diverse with your scents! A+!	positif
144	16644668	I bought this for my uncle who (at the time) was an athletic guy in his late 20's. When I tested the scent on a paper card, I was very pleased with how good it was (and no headache from any of the fragrance notes). He ended up finishing the bottle shortly after and started buying it for himself. It's a clean yet subtly musky scent that draws attention and complements. NOTE: any perfume will smell a little different on a different person; the chemical makeup of your own body slightly alters the scent	positif
145	1763568	This fragrance is now my absolute favourite I own! Its so long lasting and is quite a strong scent, which is perfect as it doesn't fade throughout the day like most perfumes. The scent is gorgeous, its has a warm jasmine scent but with a spicy gingery fizz to it. It smells very luxurious and is well worth the money as the bottle will last a long time. The packaging is also beautiful, I really like the updated clear glass bottle and the copper accents, definitely one to display on your shelf!	positif
146	19636460	Perfect scent for women who aren’t fans of florals I’m the girl that wears men’s colognes more than women’s fragrances because I am not a fan of sweet, fruity-smelling florals. When I received this perfume complimentary for review I was skeptical, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. This scent is the perfect balance of feminine floral and spicy musk. It’s wears well and a little goes a long way. I will be repurchasing this scent as my everyday go-to.	positif
147	19077770	This scent is long lasting. Smells very feminine, for mature women. The fragrance has different notes, each give off at different times. At first the scent smells fresh and green, not floral, then the vanilla notes kick in, and are the notes that stay, yet you still get a hint of the green/fresh scent. The perfume dries down to a subtle musky vanilla. It’s definitely a unique perfume!!	positif
148	18035504	I love this fragrance! I can’t describe the scent all that great but it smells sweet with a little bit of spice. It’s long wearing Too and the perfume is presented beautifully	positif
149	15144414	The perfume fragrance is very unique and strong and not to my taste, it remind me of my grandma. The other products in here smell less of the scent so I like them best	positif
150	13062328	Such a gorgeous fragrance. The bottle is even beautiful. I always say that it would be the perfect wedding scent because it's just one of those perfumes that smells amazing and would look so fab in photos	positif
151	23762251	This perfume smells so good. Nice sweet scent, but not sickly sweet. Fragrance is long lasting. More expensive than some perfumes but good value. The bottle is nice too. Would recommend.	positif
152	10535205	I love this perfume! It smells so light and nice, great gift! I got mine at Macy's and the scent lasts all day. This is one of my everyday fragrances.	positif
153	11861061	This is a very pleasant,not strong perfume. It has a lasting fragrance and smells great on anyone. It's one of my favs. A little goes a long way. not a floral scent	positif
154	7817427	This scent is pure grown woman status!! This is completely a going out or evening scent, it's incredibly long lasting and very strong and you need the tiniest amount, over spraying this one will probably give someone around you a headache and if you not into rich, intense, warm, musk, slightly floral scents you won't like this at all. If you like Miss Dior or Flowerbomb you'll enjoy this scent, this is the type of fragrance that if you wear it and know it you'll be able to smell it on others it's a distinct scent and there's nothing quite like this, it's a timeless perfume!!	positif
155	7818257	This is an amazing fragrance! Great for any occasion and smells so amazing, the scent just lingers all day long and even the day after. It is a must have if you are a perfume lover.	positif
156	7819802	Chanel Coco Mademoiselle is my signature fragrance. i has love scent that last all day. this perfume is for women of all ages in my opinion. I just love the smell so much =)	positif
157	7819917	This fragrance is ...amazing. Very soft but not too soft to the point where others won't smell your scent. It's a great perfume, well worth the cost.	positif
158	19831031	I adore this fragrance. It's a great subtle sweet scent. I love how it smells on my skin as opposed to my clothing...either way it's an amazing perfume.	positif
159	18149650	Used as much wedding perfume and it always makes me smile when I smell it. Its the best most beautiful scent and very clean. I absolutely recommend this fragrance!	positif
160	23516259	This has became the perfume I grab everyday. The smell is distinct and absolutely stunning, different from your usual Chanel fragrance. The scent lasts all day, 10/10.	positif
161	7812623	Legit this perfume smells so fresh and sexy. I love when my boyfriend wears it. I even wear it often. If you're fan of fresh scent fragrance, this is the one. 	positif
162	17723714	My go-to high-end fragrance! You can still smell this perfume 24 hours after using it, so it is very long lasting. Very classy scent	positif
163	14305138	Love the smell! Complements all the time. Long lasting fragrance. I am a first time user but I will be repurchasing this perfume. Scent is not too strong.	positif
164	17297087	Love this . It's my favorite fragrance . It's not a flowery scent maybe some mid tones but it's not what stands out in the perfume . I smell sweetness and some sandlewood .	positif
165	15671189	I love the smell of this perfume. Received it as a birthday gift. The fragrance lasts all day. I recommend it to anyone that likes a strong musky scent.	positif
166	16673019	The perfumes of Carolina Herrera are spectacular I love the fragrance of this because it is a very masculine scent but a little soft and delicious to the smell	positif
167	5938715	I really wanted to love this perfume as I owned the previous Sinner. Because I use to douse myself in this scent, it is unforgettable to the nose for a fragrance once beloved. This is closer than Saint, but I would call Sinner 2.0 a cousin of the original. That being said, it is a lovely smell. My review is of the tangible product I bought. Sinner 2.0 smells of slight musk/cologne with very strong notes of jasmine. It is the type of scent that is in all sense sexy. It's a scent you'd smell after a rendezvous with a lover. That being said, I'm going to see how long the scent lasts before a decision.	positif
168	6218728	Out of Kat Von D’s Saint and Sinner perfumes, Sinner is definitely my favourite and a more complex scent than Saint. The heart of the fragrance is a mix of cinnamon, vanilla and white florals with base notes of vetiver, patchouli and wood. While I am normally drawn to fruity scents, there is just something about this that is so sultry and alluring. It smells strong at first, but once it sinks into the skin, it is the perfect blend of sweet and woodsy. Feminine. Confident. A statement scent. It reminds me of autumn, which is my favourite season. This scent definitely seems like it is best suited for a night out, but I am the type of person who would use this as an every day scent too. Sinner lasted most of the day on me.	positif
169	16715276	I fell in love with this scent! It smells super duper good! This has become my favorite perfume/fragrance. It has comforting notes of Madagascar vanilla, tonka bean, and goji berry.	positif

172	25788715	a classic This has been my go-to fragrance for years. It evokes the best of the rose scent without making me smell like an old lady. This is hands down, my favorite perfume!	positif
173	22847877	This perfume smells incredible! It is feminine and light but the scent lasts all day. This is my go-to fragrance at the moment.	positif

180	14882237	This is pretty much my favorite fragrance. The scent is incredible, most perfumes can smell quite artificial but this smells stunning. Its both warm and fresh and perfect for day or night.	positif
181	4851449	I purchased this fragrance due to its unique scent. Usually, I prefer floral scents, but I enjoyed the light woody smell that came along with rose scent. I've had this fragrance for 2 years and the scent is still as powerful to me as the first time I tried it. It is long lasting, but I've found that after a couple of hours, the hemp smell outlasts the other scents in the perfume, leaving my clothes smelling of weed. The smell lingered more on my wool coats during the winter. Other than that, this scent is very versatile for women of all ages during several different occasions.	positif
182	5071543	It's a great fragrance if you're looking for a signature scent because it smells good but it doesn't give you a headache like other perfumes	positif
183	10521713	It is one of my favorite perfume to wear. I love the floral scent. It's a fragrance that I would choose because of the pleasant smell. Love it!	positif

185	18749125	Woman is a fairly new fragrance, and it has quickly become one of my go-to’s. It’s a timeless scent, without smelling like your Grandmother’s perfume.	positif
186	5129591	glorious, emotional, sea. I work at Sephora. While we have a lot of fragrances that are unbelievably succulent and wonderful, this is my favorite. The scent of this perfume is not really the scent of perfume, but a scent that smells of wealth. It's makes me feel like I'm Dickie Greenleaf in the Talented Mr. Ripley. In my late twenties, enjoying the fruits of a trust fund and high class upbringing- riding on a sail boat in the Mediterranean. It's rich without being obvious. It smells like just getting back from vacation on the sea where the last bit of salt and sand still clings to the grooves in your sandals. It's the cleanliness of someone who can afford the best soaps and creams. This scent gives me memories I've never had. It truly is unbelievable.	positif
187	1834640	This perfume smells divine - I would recommend it to anybody who loves a slightly musky scent. The bottle is amazing and the fragrance is unique. My new favourite!	positif
188	10541193	Smells amazing and the scent actually last on you. I get compliments all the time on this fragrance and it is also not a very strong perfume so it would be good for people with allergies.	positif
189	24259584	Feminine Blend of Fruity, Floral and Light Must ScentTHE VERA WANG EMBRACE PERFUME IS A FRUITY FLORAL FRAGRANCE THAT BLENDS DEWY NOTES OF MELON WITH THE FLORALLY GARDENIA AND MARIGOLD WITH ALONG WITH SOME SOFT MUSK MAKING IT A DIVINE FEMININE SCENT. I LOVE WEARING IT DURING THE DAY BECAUSE IT’S SUCH A DIVINE FEMININE SCENT THAT MAKES ME FEEL SO FRESH AND FEMININE.

191	15427487	I believe you are not finished dressing until you finish with a scent. Each person has a signature scent they are know for. It took me almost 10 years of experimenting to find something that truly complimented my chemistry and created a perfectly balanced scent. When I discovered Vera Wang Look, my search was over. I can't tell you just how many people ask me what is the perfume I am wearing. I get so many compliments on it. There is truly one that you always go back to because others notice the fragrance on you. This one is definitely me. It is not over powering at all but has a very seductive, floral, lasting scent. I absolutely love it. Smelled strong initally from the bottle but once on you, it blends with your own chemistry wonderfully.	positif
192	15942025	This is the best bath and body works scent to date. I love the beachy smell and light perfume fragrance. Leaves my skin soft and smooth!	positif
193	24645789	New Fave My new everyday fragrance! I love how fresh it smells with a subtle florally and sweet aroma that doesn’t overpower like most perfumes. Perfect scent for spring and summer!	positif
194	4922879	I love this scent so much! Much like others' complaints, I don't find this fragrance to last very long, but I rate it 5 stars nonetheless. It's very light, fresh, sweet, and feminine. It's a perfect signature scent, a perfect spring and summer scent, a perfect day time scent, it's really delightful. I also like that because it's so light, it's also a perfect layering perfume. I like to use it as a base for pairing with D&G Light Blue or YSL L'Homme. I think it's the best smelling perfume of the Splash line and you should definitely give this a try!	positif
195	19635985	Sensual and luxurious I just discovered a new fragrance that smells magical, Marc Jacobs Decadence Eau So Decadent. It is a sensual and luxurious perfume with a woody scent. The woody scent mixed with flowers makes for a glamorous feel. I would definitely recommend this perfume for a date night scent. It’s sexy, a little spicy and a total feeling of luxury. The smell is warm, woody and carries a bouquet of flowers. That’s a combination I’m hot for! It is a mature perfume and with only one spray you are left with a delicious, sensual, glamorous and warm scent throughout the day.	positif
196	19665545	Great Perfume I love the smell of this fragrance I was looking for a new scent and was so happy to get this. It’s like and feminine and works well for work or play.	positif

198	16611656	This fragrance mist is amazing. It smells so woods-y and sweet at the same time. Which is great because some woods-y perfumes can push more towards a men's cologne scent.	positif
199	17873126	Omg this perfume smells lovely! It was giving to me as a gift and boy am I thankful. The scent last ALL DAY and is truly a fragrance you can wear everyday.	positif
200	19670012	Fun, and Romantic Scent. This perfume has such a lovely fragrance! It's a sweet floral scent, like a bouquet of flowers mixed with candy/fruit. It's perfect for daytime or night time wear and the smell isn't over powering or obnoxious. I don't wear perfume much at all, but this one is definitely worth wearing!	positif
201	13035327	"I love this perfume and it has quickly become my new ""go to"" fragrance. I love the warm scent from the first spray all the way through the day. It smells dark, creamy and rich!!! My only complaint is that it does not last on my skin, but it will stay on my clothing or in my hair. It is a great cold weather scent!"	positif
202	4679827	This is my absolute favorite perfume since the very first time I ever used it. I have never repurchased a fragrance as often as this one, nor have I ever used one that has a longer lasting scent! I can go through my entire day from morning until late at night and STILL smell its gorgeous scent on my skin! Yes it is very pricey, but in my opinion, its well worth it!	positif
203	4871567	good value. The floral and sweet notes in this perfume are amazing! The scent is different on everyone, so I'd suggested obtaining a sample or getting a sample at Sephora to see what it smells like on you. On some the fragrance is more floral and delicate, whereas on others it's sweet and enchanting. A great scent either way!	positif
204	4871737	I recieved a free sample and I fell completely in LOVE with this fragrance. It's like a breathe of fresh air and makes me feel beautiful while wearing it. This scent is perfect for any occasion and especially on those days where you want to feel as pretty as you smell. The scent lingers for hours and gets many compliments. Highly recommend this perfume.	positif
205	22594146	This is the quintessential scent of summer, or anytime you want to pretend you’re at the beach. I can literally smell the duality of ocean and sun on my skin with this. It is a long lasting fragrance. This perfume immediately evokes memories of vacations and sweet times at the shore. It has quickly become my favorite scent.	positif
206	15058922	One of the scent i really love. And not only me. I remember i went out shopping and i was wearing this perfume, i got at least 3 people asked what perfume i was wearing because it really smells good. This scent isn't strong but it lasts a long time, even the following day, you can smell the fragrance on your clothes.	positif
207	4971658	good value, fresh. I have tried so many fragrances over the years and I always seem to come back to this one. I always get compliments on how fresh I smell when I wear this scent, even from some people that usually hate ANY kind of perfume/cologne. Dior has really perfected Blooming Bouquet as an elegant, charming scent. (btw-just turned 25)	positif
208	10553244	My favorite perfume of all time . vanilla is my favorite scent ,so the fact that the main notes in this is vanilla and almond really drew me in . it is a sweet fragrance, i find it perfect for the nighttime . it also has amazing staying power , i will put my scarf on that i wore a couple days ago and it will still smell like hypnotic poison ! the title really captures this scent	positif
209	12364041	Omg I LOVE this scent! Happy is one of the first scents of perfume I started wearing as a teenager so it always takes me back to those simpler times when I smell it. It has such a long lasting fragrance that does not quickly fade like other cheaper brands. It smells like summer time with a hint of floral, perfect for those summer days. I would highly recommend this scent	positif
210	23027251	This is my go to fragrance whether it’s for everyday or special occasions. My Chanel perfumes always get compliments and the fragrance last so long I can still smell it on my skin the next day sometimes. It’s not a scent that is over powering and gives headaches. The scent gives me sophisticated women vibes.	positif
211	19831859	My signature fragrance in a body spray, I could not be happier. I love to do the whole scent layering thing, so I highly recommend this product, it smells so pretty, but lighter than the actual perfume. I wish the scent lasted longer, but all in all I am really pleased. Bought it at Nordstrom, but I also think Macys carries it.	positif
212	11329263	I love this smell, most people know the scent nag champa and that's what this perfume smells like most. so if you like spiritual, more musky scents this is the scent you want. It is my favorite so far out of all the benefit fragrances I also use bathina but this is more for when im going out. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY WITH THIS ONE!	positif
213	5829057	good value. After getting this as a sample, and traveling with it on a whim to Israel before even smelling it - I have fallen in love with it. This scent transcends seasons and isn't the kind of fragrance that overtakes the room, but is subtle enough, long lasting, and unique that it will be your scent. I love this perfume and will continue to purchase it.	positif
214	24705779	This is a delicious and unique scent. It's a citrus scent that smells heavily of orange (not initially my cup of tea!), but the combination with the other notes is really lovely  - the result is a fresh, uplifting, sexy and elegant perfume where you can tell that they have used only high quality materials. This is long lasting on my skin and I think both men and women can wear this fragrance.	positif
215	15505648	I once read that the best way to keep the scent of your perfume on your skin all day long was applying it right after a butter of cream to moisturize your skin. So that is exactly what I do ever since! And this... my God this is amazing! Has an amazing subtle scent that does not mess with my fragrance but still smells amazing and keeps my skin soft all day long. I love it!	positif
216	17749476	This is my signature fragrance. It is amazing. I wear it only on special occasions. I love that you can wear it all year round. During fall, winter and spring and summer. It has a hint of a citrus scent. It smells sexy. I've had several guys complement the scent of this perfume.	positif
217	6213181	This fragrance is so unique compared to other perfumes I own. The scent last for awhile, I can smell throughout the day. Love the hints of floral while not being old lady like. I strongly believe this scent will become one of my daily scents versus what I'm currently using. *i received this product complementary from influenster	positif
218	4932427	I bought this perfume at my local Sephora store. I went to buy Lazy Sunday but they only had the roll on, so I tested this one. I admit that the initial scent on me was, frankly awful. But then it dried down to the sexiest scent I've smelled and I own close to 100 fragrances. This one is a keeper!!! I can't stop spraying it.	positif
219	20221463	The most distinctive, unique fragrance I have ever tested out/tried. I love how clean it smells. It does not give me a headache like a lot of perfumes do and it stays on forever. It has a subtle smell of liquorice, it is just a very wearable scent that you do not encounter normally. Love it. My signature scent.	positif
220	7834329	My fave new scent. I bought a gift box with 3 small perfume bottles to get a free tote bag! The fragrance last a long time. I feel it is a bit pricey, but well worth the money spent. The scent is undescriable kinda sweet, but not over powering. You don't need to spray much to get the full impact of the smell. Just wonderful!	positif
221	18841037	I really enjoyed the scent from this trial product, I find it is pretty on par with any other perfume brand regarding price for a designer fragrance. The scent lasted about 3-4 hours and then you need to re apply, I think most are like this. It is very sweet smell and you don’t need to apply much. I find it quite strong but I like the sweet smell.	positif
222	11084779	This is definitely my favorite scent from Jo Malone. It has a very clean, crisp,woodsy smell. I love to layer it with a soft floral perfume. It does need to be reapplied if you want the scent to last all day but it's definitely worth it. It's a fragrance that can be worn any time of the year.	positif
223	19931350	I am a passionate Jo Malone fragrance lover. When this scent came out I rushed to Nordstrom to try it, I ended up buying it! It smells so delicious and fresh! The smaller size was $75 which is what the perfume usually runs unless you get the bigger bottle. The scent has a fruity but earthy smell, it is very inviting. Definitely a fan of this one!!	positif
224	15668460	This fragrance is a great night time/ winter scent. It has some musky tones and smells deep and sexy!! I have seen it for sale at sephora, ulta, & perfumania. I have used it before but have not repurchased. when i use up more of my current perfumes, i would consider re-buying this scent.	positif
225	15299326	This perfume smells beautiful, it has a lovely floral scent, but not too over powering. It also has great lasting power, the scent lingers and by the end of the day I could still catch the beautiful smell. The packaging is gorgeous, a lovely dusky pink glass bottle that looks beautiful sat on the dressing table. All in all a beautiful summer fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
226	15299303	On first glance the bottle is super cute and looks very good on the dresser! The fragrance is very light and has a lovely smell of Jasmine, A very floral sweet perfume. The scent lasted all day and I only needed to apply once during the day. This is my new favourite scent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
227	18717484	Gucci is of course, always ALWAYS going to be a classic in the fragrance sector of the beauty kingdom. This scent is really great at first! But it seems as the perfume ages it’s scent changes pretty dramatically in this particular case. The florals appeal suddenly smelled like a rose garden with half dead blooms after around 3 months. Buy the smaller size unless you intend to use it up quickly.	positif
228	11863231	The amazing grace perfume is my everyday smell!! I use the amazing grace scent in my body wash, perfume, and occasional lotion!! If you don't love this floral smell as much, pure grace may be the scent for you!! (definitely go with the perfume and not the fragrance spray for a long lasting smell!)	positif
229	18075740	I absolutely love this perfume from thee kat von d<br />Other fragrances can't compare because this scent last all day!! It smells amazing I know because after I sampled it at my local Sephora store i fell in love with the scent. it's a Good investment for all women to buy if you wanna smell like a queen	positif
230	10560139	By far one of the best perfumes I've ever owned. The scent isn't too strong, it's a soft, flowery smell. The scent doesn't wear off easily like most perfumes. I received this for Christmas from my best friend but have purchased it in the past and will continue to purchase this. I give this fragrance all fingers and toes up!!	positif
231	16081026	Roses are my favorite flower, and for the longest time, I was searching for a fragrance that would pull the same scent. Most of the time, fragrances are too musky when replicating the scent of a rose, resulting in it smelling fake. This perfume smells exactly like roses. It's delicate, feminine, and wears well throughout the day. I love mixing this fragrance with Marc Jacobs Daisy and Dior J'Adore.	positif
232	24353644	This is a staple in my collection, this has a very clean but yet light floral scent that lasts for days. My sister has it as well and on her iys smells very different, unlike other fragrances that tend to have the same smell on anyone this one varies. I just love this unique fresh very femenine scent that will have people asking what perfume are you wearing.	positif
233	14882233	I absolutely love this line of Origins fragrances. This scent is perfect for day-time or night-time. Even if you think you may have sprayed too much on at once, the scent never smells too strong or sickening like some other perfumes. I will definitely buy this again if I ever finish this full-sized bottle!	positif
234	17802658	This has been my go to summer scent for the last 4-5 summers, I absolutely love it! I am a huge fan of Calvin Klein fragrances as they are always so fresh and delicate. This scent is not too sweet, which is something I dislike in a perfume and is really fruity, refreshing and ultimately the perfect summer smell! Will continue to purchase  	positif
235	24371815	"After a shower love to spray this perfume on as it smells so..... ""Refreshing"" & Clean Smelling and the Fragrance Lasts throughout the Day & Night without the problem of losing it's scent oraroma like others do! I have had numerous Compliments on this Perfume, especially from Gentleman! This Perfume even lingers on my sheets and leaves a ""Soft Subtle scent"" that is so ""Refreshing"" & Clean Smelling!"	positif
236	10533629	Love this perfume for summer and spring! It has a fresh floral scent which isn't too over powering. It is so nice and delicate smelling! A must have fragrance! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't have the longest staying power. After awhile the scent wore off and I could no longer smell it.	positif
237	5090672	I am in love! This perfume is my new signature scent! It smells exactly like a flower garden with a hint of spice. However, this perfume is not for everyone! This is definitely a more mature fragrance because of the spice in it. Think successful middle aged woman. Not a powdery grandma floral like people are making it out to be (Chanel N5) but not a sugary sweet teenager scent either	positif
238	17792144	This is my favorite fragrance that I own. The scent is delicate and leaves a wonderful smell for an entire day. The bottle is simplistic and pretty large for a perfume bottle. This vera wang scent is more sophisticated than the vera wang princess perfume. I would definitely buy this product again and again, it has definitely become a staple in my everyday beauty routine.	positif
239	5395514	I purchased this in 2009 in France in the pure perfume locket. Oh My, I wear this in spring, summer and day time only. I enjoy the floral scent that lasts all day and my clothes still have the scent on. I just use two pumps on back of neck and front and enjoy smelling lovely all day long. I will repurchase this fragrance evey time I run out.	positif
240	11057410	"This is one of my favorite fragrances ""Bath and Body"". It is a very feminine and sensual fragrance with a scent a little sweet that makes it delicious. It is a gentle lotion, full of fragrance that slips into the skin well and leaves it smooth, supple and full of life. The smell lasts for hours and is perfect to complement the scent of perfumes."	positif
241	4912760	This scent makes me feel sophisticated but modern and sexy at the same time. It's an addicting smell and it last a really long time on the skin (and clothing) as compared to many fragrances that disappear within a few hours. I'm on my second big bottle and don't ever see being without this perfume. It's my go to scent!	positif
242	1326230	This is the most beautiful summer fragrance that I have tried in a long time. I am not usually a fan of such sweet scents but It smells amazing, as if you could eat it! every time I wear this perfume I always get compliments and the scent lasts all day!I love how expensive the bottle looks. I think this is going to become my signature scent! Definitely worth a try	positif
243	4926534	This smells divine. It's just heavenly. It's considerably a bit lighter than No.5 more soapy & baby powdery than whiskey & gun powder! It still remains fierce whilst being soft spoken & well mannered. This would make a lovely thoughtful gift as I can't imagine anyone would find less than inoffensive & well intentioned. It's not cheap, but hey you pay in dividends when it comes to perfumes unless you want Fantasy it's best to err on the side of good taste! I can't think of a better way to sink $65. Less aldehyde & more sweetness than the original. I detect very little sweetness in the original no.5 so this is refreshing like 7up poured over vanilla ice cream--fizzy & creamy sweetness merge w a cola note. I don't know why I thought this was a new perfume but it's going to have a permanent spot in my collection.	positif
244	23516193	I've tried this fragrance many times. At first I liked the fragrance, but the price seemed very high. I did not buy the bottle. but took the sample for testing. What I want to say. The longer I use it, the more I like it. Clearly at the beginning I feel aldehydes. Then a green note appears. In twenty minutes - pure musk. Then, in about ten minutes - a lemon mixed with lime, grapefruit and bergamot. Without flowers. The fragrance is balanced, you do not get tired of it. This is an office version, ideal for situations where you can not experiment with perfume. On myself I hear 6-7 hours exactly (I use 1 spraying). In general, I recommend. Perfume worthy, elegant, emphasizes good taste.  CHANEL Gabrielle Chanel, Eau De Parfum Spray	positif

I have crazy oily skin and it’s hard to wear makeup without looking oiling an hour after apply but this product truly keeps my oils at bay! I love this product it smells good feels good taste good lol truly happy I searched like crazy for this product. I will continue to purchase this powder. Too Face you did it!!!	positif
254	8232981	this lip gloss does work well in the pumping area, it was a nice smell and a good taste. the only downside to this is that after awhile it starts to burn and sting. when using this i would suggest keeping it on for 10-15 minutes then takign it off, if you have sensitive skin. if not, it isnt that bad.	positif
255	11579394	Good taste,smells great but I don't like the texture...the price was inexpensive at all.it a good value,great quality! Very easy to apply and to use.long lasting!i recomend to add color from an old lipstick and to mix with the lip balm.i will buy it again.	positif
256	17947643	These are one of my all time favorite lip balms in terms of moisture. I personally am not a fan of the smell however I do remember it had a good taste. It really made my lips feel plump and kissable after use and my sister stole it all the time. My boyfriend loved the taste of it and often used it too. Great product 	positif
257	6041446	i personally think this lip product is amazing, smells really good, taste is fine not great but not horrible and the colour is to die for, its not pigmented but you can tell there's something on your lips, kind of like a shimmery nude. it's easy to apply and feels really good on the lips, it's so creamy and moisturizing.absolutely love this product defiantly going to buy more	positif
258	8190723	Perfect color, smells good and have a good taste. Very easy to use and to open. Good to carry on the purse because its small. It´s a little bit expensive here in Brasil, but it worth it. I use it always when i have a party to go. I would totally buy it again.	positif
259	10953358	My boyfriend got me this as an I love you gift a couple years ago and I still have a little bit left. Clearly he has good taste (thanks to me :)) ) You only need a couple spritz of this! It lasts you a long time! Smells so sooo good! We will be repurchasing another once I run out! :)	positif
260	24883599	There is No gross chemical smells. I think it has a good taste to it as well. It worse pretty darn good, one of the Greatest lip plumpers that I've used. I do love this Company for all of their lip products that I've tried. I don't know about any of their other makeup products.	positif
261	4854035	creamy, long wearing, moisturizing, comfortable, great color selection, smell good, taste good. I am basically on the mission to collect all of these because I am in love. My favorite every day color so far - Fig. LOVE love love fig and I want to wear it everyday. If you are going get just one, get Fig.	positif
262	8276345	If this stuff was cheaper, I would never wear anything else on my lips. It's so incredibly creamy and moisturizing. It smells amazing and seems to have a good taste as well. This color, beetroot, is a little bit intense for my pale skin and light hair complexion but the color itself is beautiful and would flatter most skin tones.	positif
263	11572255	"This lip balm is pretty much a classic! I love the way it goes on the lips and how long it lasts. It keeps my lips moisturized for long and I've noticed that it helps when my lips are cracked in the winter time. The one thing I don't like about the product is that it doesnt have a good ""taste""/smell."	positif
264	18686718	I? love Carmen! It is so easy to apply, easy to carry. Just don’t lk when u leave it n a hot car and u open it it’s liquid but I? guess it’s not so bad. No good taste but it’s long lasting smells great and very cheap. I? buy it often actually. I? usually recommend this product to friends	positif
265	6222017	If you love this scent or sweet patchouli based fragrances, this is a great purchase. It lasts FOREVER and it's super strong. Even when I just put a little drop on my wrist and neck, I could smell this all around me, all day. I'm assuming others could as well, so that's something to consider. This could be easily overdone, so I would build up depending on your taste and avoid spraying on clothes. For me personally, this made it quite cloying and I got tired of it. It has a super sweet, synthetic smell. I was hoping the patchouli would make it more natural, but this is definitely a perfume vs. a skin scent. Also - A LOT of people wear this as their signature scent. I see this as a party, wedding or bedtime fragrance vs. an everyday office scent where you might offend some coworkers if you overdo it. Overall, a beautiful, high quality scent, but try to take it for a test drive to see how it wears on you!	positif
266	5839611	sexy, bold, clean, woody, multidimensional. Try your best to get rid of the marketing image of this perfume. It does not represent well what this perfume invokes. This perfume is complex, and yet, I do think that it is a fragrance for everyone. Everyone can get something out of this scent. Whether you love fresh, floral, spicy or gourmand, there is something for you. From the initial spray, it will be very similar to Black Opium because of the mixture of tonka beans and vanilla. Whereas Black Opium stays true to itself throughout, Poison Girl transforms itself. As it dries, it smells woody and soapy while preserving that initial gourmand smell. In short, initially it smells like a night-scent that dries down to feel more like a day scent with a bit of a kick to it. Usually, I love the initial scent and dread the dry down of most perfumes. This is the opposite. Rather, I enjoy this fragrance throughout and love the dry down. It just smells like dried wood with the initial smell. If you don't spray a lot, you can use this as a day scent. I wear this in the spring and yet I can see myself wearing this more in the fall.	positif
267	18408482	I was reading reviews for Poison Girl on Fragrantica and a lot of them are very deragotory towards this scent saying it shouldnt be in the Poison family etc etc etc. I love this little fragrance. I mean yeah its been done before but that does not detract from what a lovely scent this is. Its a very warm and creamey scent. Like a creamsicle. I can detect the almonds very well. Poison Girl makes me think i have lightly sprinkled myself with rice krispies cocoa puff cereal. I can imagine tinker bell smelling like this while she flits around leaving a lovely trail of orange, roses, vanilla, and almonds. Towards the end of the scent a wonderful, comforting suede like note appears. It is the cashmerean note. I didn't think i was going to detect it but i can. Also, i think the bottle is lovely too. Lovely shades of pinks and reds all coalescing in twists and turns all the way up to the cap of the bottle. An innocent demure lovely scent that should be part of your precious perfume collection.	positif
268	17273888	I LOVEEEEE THIS PERFUME SO MUCH, IT'S MY LIFE AND EVERYTHING. I remember seeing this perfume in stores but never trying/testing it to see how it smells or anything. My younger sister's name is Grace so every time I smell or think of this fragrance, I think of her! I love how Coty/Philosophy let me have a new bottle when I told/showed them how my current bottle's nozzle was all messed up (jammed) and how it wouldn't spray and it would leak on the sides. Love this perfume though, can't think of any scents I like anymore LOLLL (I love this scent more than any Marc Jacobs, Dior, and many popular fragrance companies). This might be a hit or miss with some people. &nbsp;It's definitely a feminine and beautiful, cuteness scent. So it's not a strong scent at all for those strong scent lovers. It's also not a flower-floral scent.	positif
269	1284241	One of my favorite Jo Malone fragrances. This scent is definitely a Spring season scent. It opens up fresh, crisp, clean and slightly floral and sweet. I have never smelled a bluebell before, but this smells like what I imagine a blue flower to smell like. I can smell the hint of violet and towards the middle of the scent, I can detect the hint of citrus. It''s a very light, refreshing perfume that isn''t overtly floral and does not turn sour on me like a lot of citrus heavy perfumes would do. The longevity is better when comparing to other JM colognes. I''d say I get a good 3-4 hours. This layers beautifully with Wood Sage	positif
270	19680372	"Lovely floral with sweet accents If smelling this or any other scent for the first time, spray it on a tissue wait a few seconds, then breathe and smell the fragrance. this perfume is my all time favorite. I don't mean to sound cliché, but my initial reaction was like when the glass slipper fit Cinderella. it was perfect! It has a lovely ( not pungent) floral smell that is followed by a soft sweet scent. I have found that the best way to put a fragrance on (so not to overpower), is to spray on a surface, then dab with your fingers and place the scent where you want. then people can say that you smell nice, not that the perfume is nice. (""You wear the dress, don't let the dress wear you""). Enjoy!"	positif
271	16715132	Love this scent! You only need one spritz and you will be smelling fabulous all day into the night. The scent sticks to you so you don’t need to carry a pocket size around. The scent is warm but still has a sweet note in it. I received so many compliments. It is a little pricey but I bought it from ulta when they had a points offer of 3x the point for members when making a perfume fragrance! They always have points offer so if you’re a member I would buy there to get even more for your money. Since you don’t have to spray and spray this perfume to get long lasting wear, you definitely get your moneys worth!	positif
272	10549141	This was my first time using an oil for a fragrance. I was skeptical at first but i really liked it! The oil not only smells delicious, but I love how it nourishes my skin as well! I feel like the oil scent was more long lasting than just the regular perfume, and the scent was light enough that you could pair them together without it being too much. I love floral scents, and this one had a slight musky scent to it that made it smell very couture. I got a lot of compliments with this perfume and I would definitely buy. I received this for free from influenster for testing purposes.	positif
273	5234952	good value. What a beautiful, decadent, sexy scent! I had never received a sample of this, never knew anyone else that wore it but was intrigued when I heard it had a cherry note, so I bought it scent un-smelled and totally fell in love with it. It smells like cherries mixed with other pleasant notes on me, from start to finish, absolutely incredible. There's not a lot of perfumes I like, most burn my nose, but my favs are the elizabeth & james fragrances, but this is a close second to those. This is a very sweet scent, so if you're not crazy about those, you probably won't like, but I am in Heaven with this.	positif
274	19664552	Fantasy in a bottle This is a great scent. Very unique. Never smelled anything a fragrance quite like this before. And I am a huge fan of anything Dior. The only problem I have with it is that this fragrance is very subtle. The scent does not last long on me. Maybe 2-3 hours and then I have to reapply, which I do not like because I bought the 1 oz bottle and I think for the price, I should not have to keep repaying it. Also, the bottle caught my eye. Its very cute! I think this perfume will stay in my lineup, but I just wish the scent lasted longer.	positif
275	22543774	When I first smelled Gabrielle, there was a undertone scent that I didn’t really like. I’m a huge fan of Chanel fragrance cause it’s the only perfume brand that stays on ALL day. I wore Chanel gold Chance for years. I got a sample from Bloomingdale’s. After spraying it on and having it mix with my skin chemistry, I fell in love. The undertone scent I didn’t like didn’t exist. I’m a huge fan now! It stays on all day and I get SO many compliments on it. I found my new scent :)	positif
276	6213101	I received Because it's You free from Influenster, and here are my honest thoughts! This is a very, very sweet smelling perfume. They say this fragrance has hints of vanilla, raspberry, and rose. I smelled the raspberry initially, and throughout the day smell more of the rose with a hint of vanilla. Scent does last all day. Bottle design is beautiful and classic. This scent would be great as a rollerball to get a hint of sweet rather than a full spray (I prefer a more musky scent.). Overall, I do like the fragrance and am excited to wear it and see what others think as well!! Thank you Influenster and Emporio Armani!	positif
277	6094366	I wore this scent for about a year before I realized it was technically a male fragrance. I think it's totally unisex appropriate - it smells nothing like what I typically think of when I think traditional cologne smell. And also, wear whatever scent you want - who cares. It's very sultry, a little spicy. On my skin it smells very warm and a bit sweet over time. I love it. I also find that some perfume now smells very alcohol heavy to me, very synthetic. Jazz Club smells very high-quality to me, very rich and concentrated. I definitely don't plan on changing my scent anytime soon!	positif
278	7840831	"My favorite perfume! The best scent for a woman. Its a bit strong but trust me you'll love it and you're clothes will too because it stays on for a while.

Its a funny thing, I actually know the scent very well that I've asked random people wearing it if it was actually Mademoiselle and I always get nostalgic. I love this scent, it is a staple.

280	22700974	it’s a yes for me... I personally LOVE this scent. It is true that this is by no means a flowery scent. It really does resemble a cologne, Million by Paco Rabanne to be exact, but I love that! I only have the sample size, and just sprayed it on my arm but I literally cannot stop smelling it. I’m a little disappointed this scent isn’t available in a smaller size, as I have a lot of perfumes in rotation and much prefer 1-1.5 oz. bottles. I hope Juicy eventually makes this fragrance in a smaller size.	positif
281	23732583	This scent is light, beautiful and lasts a really long time. It’s my favourite jo malone cologne. It states that it is a Autumnal fragrance but I don’t think that, it’s a year round scent for me. It’s fruity with a hint of floral to me.. NOTE (top) king William pear (heart) freesia and (base) patchouli.. it’s not the cheapest perfume but if your looking for a unique scent that you don’t smell a lot go for jo malone. Sold in house of fraise in the uk. If I could only pick one of her scents it would be this one ???????? 100% recommend this cologne.	positif
282	5168932	Went into Sephora had my mind set on another fragrance . I told the woman I liked sweet , clean scents and she had me smell this , put it on a card and I instantly fell in love , I could not stop smelling that card . I ended up walking out with the scent card she had sprayed this on and I could not stop thinking about that scent , I kept having my fiancé smell it and was thinking to myself , this is my scent . It was perfect ! I ended up back at Sephora the next morning running to Gucci section in the fragrance section . I could not be any more pleased with flora gorgeous gardenia perfume it's timeless , effortless and it smells fantastic &lt;3	positif
283	5412867	I love how soothing Burberry Fragrances smell! I came across this Burberry Body Tender one day, while I was out shopping for new perfumes. I fell in love with the scent that I purchased it. Since then, I have been using this scent with no intentions of changing. It has now become my go-to scent! Personally, I work with kids who have nose allergies and cannot stand strong fragrances. As such, I have to mind what I use if I want to use any. Life is dull without perfume. Its torturous to totally avoid perfumes! Luckily I found this Burberry Body Tender! So far, there were no complains but only compliments for it. I would definitely stock up on this!	positif
284	4816632	warm, floral. This perfume has got to be my favorite perfume I've ever tried. It smells like a warm floral scent and really does remind me of a rainy garden. I will probably be asking this for my birthday since I just ran out. This scent doesn't have the strongest silage, but I think the smell compensates. It does die down after a few hours, but it leaves a nice soft warm scent that is still detectable by the end of the day. I also have to add that the bottle it comes in is very heavy and beautiful. It is definitely something that would look lovely on a vanity or coffee table. The aesthetics of the bottle goes quite nicely with the theme of the fragrance (trench coats, London rain, etc.).	positif
285	5008073	If you read the directions and dampen your skin beforehand this dries down nicely. I didn't really care for the smell because it was the charcoal scent(which was ok) but the fake perfumey fragrance that they tried to mask the charcoal scent with is awful . They have that scent in a lot of their products and it's too fake smelling. I saw some blackheads pulled out afterwards and it was pretty satisfying. It will NOT take out all of your blackheads at once, just like any other product, they have to be used overtime. I am going to do mine 3 days in a row along with another mask. That's how you get results.	negatif
286	14302394	I adore this fragrance. It is such a clean smell and it lasts for a while. I wear one spritz of this perfume on my chest when I get ready in the morning or right after I take my shower. It lasts all day and when I am working, I often get compliments on how clean and fresh I smell. I think that is amazing when I am only using one spray of this scent. The packaging is so simple, clean and timeless. I love having this out on my vanity. All in all, I would recommend this product if you like the scent. I think it is a great every day scent that truly lasts. 	positif
287	6090317	I received this perfum as a compliment from Insfluenster. This is the light, sweet daytime fragrance I've been wanting for all along. The tart fruit and caramel scent is immediately apparent at first, but then it fades into a light and airy jasmine, vanilla, and sandalwood scent. It has sightly moderate sillage, and becomes a skin scent after a few hours, but will linger around a bit on your clothes all day. I would wear this when I simply want to smell nice and sweet; great for everyday wear, especially in the spring and summer. It has a little bit of everything I like in perfume notes, so it's perfect. It layers well with Sinner, too! But if i have to choose I definitely pick the Saint one.	positif
288	6076692	In contrast to Saint, Sinner is a scent that is spicier, containing key notes of patchouli, wood, and cinnamon. This fragrance is sultry, sexy, and is perfect for wearing on a night out. Since I prefer Saint over Sinner, I can't say I've worn this scent as often, but the best way I can describe it is that it smells like an amped up version of Saint. It's not my type of scent, but as both fragrances can be layered together, I think I'll be wearing these two a lot on night outs. I received this perfume free for review purposes.	positif
289	6218685	I'm a perfume collector, so getting to try the new @katvondbeauty perfumes has been a dream come true! Saint is a very beautiful florally fresh scent. It's really nice for everyday use with its vanilla, jasmine, musk key notes, and is wonderful on its own at the office and then layered with Sinner to transition into the evening. Sinner is my personal favorite out of the two. The key notes in this fragrance are wood, patchouli, and cinnamon. This scent has so much depth and during it's wear time I can catch hints of varies notes, such as vanilla and jasmine that compliment the spicy notes so lovely. I love the rich, almost creamy, scent of this perfume. These perfumes smell very prestigious and you can tell immediately that @katvondbeauty put a lot of thought and work into.	positif
290	10550611	"Wow! Absolutely fell in love with this fragrance when I first smelled it. This scent in particular, sinner, is such a lovely kind of ""warm"" scent. More sweet, but deep tones as opposed to floral, which I tend to prefer. This is a more memorable perfume, that you pay attention to, and demands to be recognized but still in a subtle way. I would compare it to the Elizabeth & James Nirvana fragrance. It's the kind of fragrance that is deeper, and ""sensual"", more mysterious and grown up than a girly flowery, candy, or ""clean"" scent. Not sure of the tones but think more amber and vanilla. I think it's perfect for any weather really, but I cant wait to buy a bigger size for the winter/fall. "	positif
291	19965821	When I heard Kat Von D was coming out with a Saint and a Sinner perfume, I thought it was a bit of a gimmick. However, after trying Saint I love it! It works well with my body chemistry and lasts all day.  Kat Von D Saint Eau de Parfum has a light scent, much lighter than Sinner. I definitely smell the floral notes, but I can still smell a touch of vanilla and musk. However, I would not say this is a musky perfume at all. Since it's so nice and light this will definitely be my summer scent! Notes:Fragrance Family: floral Scent Type: classic floral Key Notes: vanilla, jasmine, musk 	positif
292	5038766	powdery, unique, pretty, light, warm, fresh, sweet. Light. Warm. Fresh. Sweet. Powdery. It's a really lovely and delicate scent. Perfect for a date night or days when you're feeling light and airy.. for some reason a baby shower comes to mind? The bottle pictured is the older version so they fized the nozzle. It's a normal perfume with a bottle and a cap. It's perfect and I love how unique Givenchy fragrances look.. They're suck a welcome edition to my dresser. This scent is definitely one I'm going to reach for when I;m feening for a clean scent, but want a warmer touch. Perfect for Dolce and Gabanna Light Blue lovers who want a similar fresh smell but more warmed up for Fall and Winter.	positif
293	20315104	Alien is one of my signature scents. I wear it when I'm feeling bold and like I want to stand out. You can't blend into the crowd wearing this perfume! If someone comes near me and they're wearing it, I instantly know it. It's recognisable to everyone who knows it. It's not a quiet scent. It's incredibly long lasting and almost leaves a trail behind you.This scent is a love it or hate it type of fragrance. I think Thierry Mugler enjoys creating controversial fragrances. If you haven't experienced this scent in your life, please go and give it a smell. You might love it as much as I do.	positif
294	4985601	good value. This is by FAR one of my most favorites scents of cologne that my husband has. I had him test the fragrance for 2 weeks. He put the fragrance on daily and it has become both mine and his favorite scent. Even I used it a few times in place of my own perfume. The scent is very masculine with fresh undertones. The scent is not too strong (a la axe body spray) but it's not so subtle that you can't smell it at a close distance range.I would highly recommend this to any one, man or woman, who loves a nice fresh perfume with a decent throw!	positif
295	3194443	When I saw the release of Marc Jacobs latest Blush perfume, I just had to buy. I noticed the brand is now branching out the Daisy range into three fragrances of the Blush scent. Daisy, Daisy Eau So Fresh and Daisy Dream. Now I'm a true Marc Jacobs fan but even I was a little confused when deciding which to buy. All three scents smell slightly similar but with different degrees of fragrance subtlety. Depending on which range of scents you love will probably be your decision maker. Personally I prefer the stronger radiant scent of this Daisy Eau so fresh Blush. It's just more vibrant, warm, careful with fruity florals and light notes of pink grapefruit with a apricot base note. This scent is already my firm favourite for summer!	positif
296	25546895	The Vera Wang Embrace perfume is a fruity floral fragrance that blends dewy notes of Melon with the florally Gardenia and Marigold with along with some Soft Musk making it a divine feminine scent. I love wearing it during the day because it’s such a divine feminine scent that makes me feel so fresh and feminine. I love the combination of both fruity and floral notes that resonates to me of having a picnic next to a beautiful field of flowers while wearing feminine sun dress indulging in fresh fruit. This picture is one of me resonating these images and experience. This scent takes me to such a peaceful place that smelling it throughout the day makes me feel happy and peaceful. Vera Wang Embrace Marigold & Gardenia	positif
297	5405653	Im a big fan of the green tea perfume, and so upon seeing this bought it after smelling it once. The scent was probably affected by the rest of the surrounding scents in the store. This perfume smells almost cologne like and is definitely not a feminine scent but not entirely masculine either. I find it a very nice fresh clean out of the shower scent and personally I like colognes and so as this perfume is lighter and more feminine than say generic calvin klein cologne type scents. Overall, the packaging is lovely, its a fresh unassuming and comforting fragrance and I recommend it especially for its price.	positif
298	15630706	I am absolutely obsessed with this fragrance! I generally love everything Miu Miu so I was excited to see this perfume at Sephora. I smelled it and had to purchase the rollerball for my purse. It has become my favorite everyday scent and a lot of my others have been put on the back burner. It's hard for me to explain why I love this scent (I generally prefer 'darker' scents) and this is a bit more feminine than I usually would wear. It's feminine but also sultry and sexy...such a great scent for so many different people! I will definitely continue to purchase.	positif
299	4818656	I tested this in store because of the cute & girly bottle, I love the pink theme & the bottle cap! When I spritzed it on a tester paper, I didn't love it as much as I hoped. I own many MJ fragrances because of their pretty bottles & unique scents, this scent reminded me of many similar perfumes in the store & it had a VERY strong floral scent which I wasn't a big fan of. I could definitely smell the lily with a heavy powder scent you get in mature lady perfumes. It's too bad I didn't love it because the bottle is too darn pretty!	positif
300	19636594	Very sophisticated scent Generally when I buy fragrances I like scents that are a little more fruity than this one, but it does have a very sophisticated scent. I would wear this just not as an every day scent for me. The perfume itself lasts very long on the skin but not as long on your clothes! The packaging is so adorable, even if I hated the smell I would still keep it for the packaging as a cute piece of decor in my beauty room! I did receive this product free through influenster, but I am in no way forced to write a positive review.	positif
301	5847513	I wish they made this in a perfume. I received this in a beauty insider box and finally got around to trying it. The scent of this seemed so familiar. It's a very powdery yet slightly floral scent, perfect for every day work as I work in an emergency room where any strong fragrance is prohibited. I kept sniffing my wrist, sure that I had smelled this before. Finally tonight it clicked! This smells exactly like the old scented Cabbage Patch preemie dolls. EXACTLY like it...but not in a bad way at all! Maybe that's why I find this scent so calming and comforting, I was a Cabbage Patch doll hoarder back in the day. Can't wait to get the full size of the body oil!	positif
302	22682740	Fresh, Uplifting Light Fruity Floral One of my favorite Jo Malone fragrances. This scent is definitely a Spring season scent. It opens up fresh, crisp, clean and slightly floral and sweet. I have never smelled a bluebell before, but this smells like what I imagine a blue flower to smell like. I can smell the hint of violet and towards the middle of the scent, I can detect the hint of citrus. It's a very light, refreshing perfume that isn't overtly floral and does not turn sour on me like a lot of citrus heavy perfumes would do. The longevity is better when comparing to other JM colognes. I'd say I get a good 3-4 hours. This layers beautifully with Wood Sage	positif
303	5849986	I do not own Taylor Swift's original Wonderstruck perfume, so cannot compare Enchanted to it - but as a stand alone perfume it is gorgeous. It opens up with a strong red berry note, after a few minutes the scent of vanilla really comes through, making the berries smell less sharp and more mellow. It really adds an element of sugar to the fragrance. It becomes a skin scent after a couple of hours, but I can still smell it on my wrist at the end of the day. I also find it to last a long time on fabric. The scent does not have much projection after the first few minutes though, as a skin scent you can smell it on yourself, like if you were to smell your wrist for example, and if someone were to hug you they would smell it too. I don't think it to be a complex scent, it is vanilla and sugared berries through and through. I don't detect any floral notes. This is a very sweet and girly scent, I would wear it during the day or on a date. I really enjoy wearing this fruity, flirty and fun fragrance.Top Notes: Passionfruit, Poppy, Wild Berries.Heart Notes: Peony, Champaca, Sugar, Freesia.Base Notes: White Musk, Woody Notes, Vanilla.	positif
304	839479	I have worn this perfume since it''s debut. I call this my signature scent. This fragrance is best when first tried on your wrist and neck first because your own body chemistry can change this fragrance to smell a bit different once on. But once on it''s an intoxicating scent that is unique to me, and I love the spicey oriental notes. I always get What are you wearing? It smells divine When I wear this perfume! 5++ Stars in my book!	positif
305	941356	Long Lasting,Moisturizes Well,Smells Great I LOVE THIS CREAM. WILL USE DAY AND NIGHT. I'LL WILL BE 65 IN A COUPLE WEEKS. Not many wrinkles BUT VERY DRY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER. This really moisturizes. Plus, fragrance-free. So many creams have perfume or scent in them. Scent bothers my sinuses. So many creams have a fragrance that give you a headache. And there are plenty mattier products out there for ladies that are oilier. Will be ordering online for this.	positif
306	1278400	I just happened across this fragrance by accident. I went into Sephora for moisturizer. I am a perfume addict so of course I lingered just smelling different frangrances. I came across this particular scent and it wasn’t even a hesitation (and it’s not cheap!), but I HAD to have it! I can’t stop smelling myself now, I’m absolutely in LOVE with this scent!! Very feminine and sexy. I think my husband will love it!	positif
307	968928	I love the fresh scent of this Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo. I find myself smelling my hair every few minutes, it''s that good clean fresh scent. Like a premium perfume fragrance. The mist is very fine almost like air, different from other dry shampoos I''ve tried. No white streaks left on my dark brown hair. I tested the complimentary tester at Sephora. I''m participating in the Influenster #YourBestHair #contest	positif
308	7840667	I'm not entirely sure if I have the words to describe how magnificent this perfume is. It's a sweet, fruity scent, but with a deeper, more sultry note. It lasts on the skin all day, and a little goes a long way. Also, I don't think I've had as many men comment on how I smell as I have in the past couple of weeks since getting this fragrance. It's a great everyday scent, and I'd highly recommend it!	positif
309	19027931	An oldie but a goodie. This scent is very sentimental to me as it's a favourite of my grandmothers and one of the many perfumes she wore when I was a youngster that sticks in my mind. It's just one of those fragrances that you smell and it leaves an imprint. It's certainly not a sweet, playful scent but it will definitely get you a lot of compliments. I love the packaging it's simple and girly which is a fun twist on such a mature fragrance.	positif
310	22650829	I love this scent, and my fiancé does too. It's very complex compared to many other scents in my opinion. I feel like I can smell more individual notes than I usually do even compared to fragrances that have as many notes. I think it must play well with my chemistry. It's such a sexy scent. It's one of my favorite perfumes I've ever bought. It's been years since I've felt that way about a perfume. I usually feel meh about most.	positif
311	16717839	This warm, musky scent is just heaven in a bottle. Although it has a sweetness to it because of the vanilla and orange blossom base, it's most prominent notes are coffee and jasmine which adds to the depth of the fragrance. I wasn't really wowed by this perfume when I first smelled it but it dries down to an edgy, sweet yet spicy scent that soon became one of my favourites. It's one of those scents that people instantly recognise and I get a lot of compliments when I'm wearing it. 	positif
312	15427600	This is quite a throwback fragrance, and I must say it is one that I LOVE. I think this may be one of my all time favorites. The scent is very long lasting and a little goes a long way. This is one of those perfumes which you smell on yourself all day long. The scent itself is more of a musky type of perfume. If you prefer lighter scents, this probably would not be your pick.	positif
313	19096382	Searching for a new fragrance to replace my current perfume, I was reintroduced to #YSL’s Black Opium. I have a love hate relationship with many perfumes. I love the smell but my body hates the interaction and tries to suffocate me. When, I find a fragrance that smells good when mixed with my natural scent that does take my breath away (literally), it is a keeper. #BlackOpium is that fragrance. The scent of this perfume is so sensual and classy. I love it! It is perfect for everyday wear and special occasions.	positif
314	18325313	"I love this scent and how rich it smells and how long it lasts , it is a-little on the pricy side but it can be your special occasion perfume it's magnificent long lasting fragrance is worth it .

Although it's a high end perfume, it does not Give you the strong and poignant smell like Chanel No 5. Flowerbomb gives you a sweet floral scent perfect for spring and summer, both in cool summer nights and hot summer days. Not too strong that bugs will be flocking you, but nice enough for everyone to notice something about you. Love this scent!	positif
317	14305736	It's amazing just how Replica has truly captured a day out on the beach with this perfume. It's very fresh and light while giving you a nostalgic, relaxing feel. Not your typical fragrance. It smells like the slightly salty air at the beach. A hint of coconut that that makes you think of coconut sunscreen scent, not overbearing at all. The perfect sweet note to compliment the scent. This perfume is bound to take you to your distant memory.Sadly, it doesn't last very long though, which is such a let down considering the price.	positif

319	13035279	This scent is part of my collection since a few months. I got this as a gift from my brother . I do like the scent, but it's a bit too 'oriental' smelling for my taste.

Would definitaly recommend in the case you like warm orientals	positif
320	5394273	My HG fragrance. I'm actually wearing it now, freshly spritzed. Smells SO GOOD. It's got a clean, crisp, fresh scent. Feminine but not too musky or too floral. Perfect for me. My husband is very sensitive to perfumes and he's bought me this one several times. The first gift he ever gave me was a large size Clinique Happy with a peach bow around it. I love the way I smell, and I get compliments all the time when I've got on my Happy. This is definitely my signature scent.	positif
321	14298456	The scent is just enough floral. I purchased this from the Clinique counter at Macy's and it was a little pricey, but well worth it! The scent lasted all day!

I buy this in depart,went stores and try to do so when there is a bonus from Clinique for making a purchase. I have bought this many times over the years. A classic	positif
322	4825757	I will never not love this perfume! I discovered it in college and have had a bottle on my dresser every since. MULITPLE purchases! I don't wear it every day and I do enjoy wearing other scents, but this will always be my all time favorite. My friends actually call it the nikki scent when they smell it somewhere else :) It is a strong scent, like most Chanel fragrances are, but that's what I gravitate towards. If you like light, clean, sweet scents, this one isn't for you though.	positif
323	19676234	"Smells Heavenly! This was my first ""high end"" fragrance purchase for myself and I was a bit hesitant at first; purchasing perfume based on reviews and I am glad I did! The reviews about what it would smell like once it was applied and how it would smell was on point.

324	7818067	This is my signature scent. I've tried many different fragrances and nothing else can compare. When I wear this, people always tell me how good I smell and what is it.I feel it's priced competitively, as it seems all (good) perfumes have gone up in price.If you're on the fence, spray it on your wrists then walk around and do your shopping, smelling every so often. As it merges with your body chemistry the scent will change. It becomes so feminine and soft, but has a definite presence.	positif
325	7819811	This is my signature scent- I love changing up my perfume, but I always come back to this. It smells young and sophisticated. I feel like most of the Chanel perfumes I have tried in the past sat a little too heavy on my skin and did not seem age appropriate. However, Coco Mademoiselle is the perfect scent for me year-round. The sillage is moderate, and the perfume lasts all day for me. I highly recommend trying this fragrance!	positif
326	10543980	My signature scent. I love this fragrance so so much! It's slightly floral but more deep/cologne-esque. It's easily layered with other perfumes. It's a mature scent, meaning not for teeny boppers, but it isn't a Grammy smell either. It's sooo nice. I'm not that great at describing scents so I'd definitely go test the smell at Sephora or something.	positif
327	4832860	good value. I'm a fragrance girl, but I'm also more comfortable in my garden than I am in a club...this scent is the perfect daily scent. Light, feminine, natural and still a tad mysterious...that air that makes my husband say mm, you smell good and he thinks it's just me, not perfume. In my mind, that's perfection. I do wish it lasted longer, but the fade is gentle, not completely gone.	positif
328	4898993	I cannot stop smelling these fragrances. I got the magnolia scent in the perfume sampler and then sampled the orange sanguine and I am completely hooked on this company. Every day I cannot decide what to wear. I just layer and layer. I believe some of these are suppose to be masculine scents but I do not care. I wear them anyway. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. There is also a new scent out in another kit that I will be trying next.	positif
329	6213135	When i smelled this I instantly fell in love with this perfume. I will for sure keep it in my collection. I love that scent lasts for hours. It's such a subtle fragrance and I love ones like this one. The bottle is beautiful too. I like how simple It is. I think its such a classy scent and any woman will love it. I did receive this product for free to test and review but this is 100% my own opinion.	positif
330	16774927	I absolutely love the way that this fragrance smells on my boyfriend! I own the paired women's perfume, Because it's you and I almost like the men's version better than the women's! The scent is slightly spicy with the hints of pepper and chestnut but also fresh with the addition of sage. I think that it is the perfect fall scent because of this. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.	positif
331	7841449	The holy grail of all fragrance. Versace Bright Crystal is my go-to scent. I purchased this Dec 2014 and have been a repeat customer ever since. The bottle is gorgeous. The light floral scent is perfect and delicate. It's not too overbearing yet everyone you walk past can smell it. I get so many compliments when I wear this perfume. It is my all-time favorite and I don't know what I would do without it lol.	positif
332	19046083	This is a GORGEOUS scent for every day! It’s light yet powerful enough to make it so you don’t need to keep reapplying it throughout the day. The scent is a mixture of yuzu which is more of a citrus fruit, mixed with a pomegranate. It’s a gorgeous, clean, light smell. I would consider this to be more of a spring and summer fragrance - and I absolutely love it!I would recommend if you are looking for a light, fruity, feminine perfume.	positif

334	7843995	Gucci cologne for men is great This cologne contains mandarin, grapefruit, iron woods, and sandalwood fragrance notes. It is recommended for use during daytime. When applying the perfume, you need to consider factors that affect the natural smell of your skin. This in turn affects the way fragrances smells on you. For example, your current medications, mood, stress level, body chemistry, age, and diet may all alter the scent. Similarly, factors like dry or oily skin can affect the amount of time the scent will last after being applied.	positif
335	22749974	This is a deeply feminine , beautiful, seductive fragrance of loveliness. They are really long lasting. Perfumes tend to only linger on my skin for about 3 hours or so.. the fact that I could still smell the scent of Gucci Guilty on my arms after about 8 hours was just magical. Even after the whole day of wearing them, others can still smell it on my clothes and I always get a compliment. The scent disappears only after you wash it off! I will definitely buy them again . Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
336	22749977	"I'm so impressed with the scent of this perfume, it is unusual and unlike any other fragrance I have smelt. You can really smell the blackberry which is amazing! Usually I wouldn't go for a fragrance that I have read has anything to do with ""rose"" in it, but it's such a subtle underlying tone that you don't notice it. I think it has a modern almost spa like scent to it, which is long lasting and durable. Top marks from me :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"	positif
337	4720110	good value, travel-friendly. I am the type of girl who hates any scent that smells like super sweet vanilla or brown sugar. So...I love this perfume because the fragrance is fresh and not obnoxious like many other perfumes. Unfortunately, this perfume is extremely subtle. I feel like the scent disappears within an hour. If the fragrance lingered for a longer period of time, it would be my favorite perfume hands down.	positif
338	4723190	Amazing scent. Light, fresh, slight floral and woodsy. Colognes/Perfumes give me a slight headache often, so I opted for a lotion with my favorite fragrance. I am not disappointed. I couple pea sizes on the arms is PERFECT. I can smell the scent throughout the day. Perfect for an office setting. Smells like a vacation in Italy. Plus, since it's handcrafted in Italy, and worn by Cary Grant, this has a feeling of luxury.	positif
339	13317795	This is definitely a summer fragrance. I like to layer with the body crème after my shower then lightly spray the perfume. It is a floral scent. It is not too heavy. In fact, after a while I can no longer smell it on myself; however, other people can smell it and I receive a lot of compliments on the scent. I usually begin to wear this fragrance in May right through the end of summer.	positif
340	14881489	One of my new favorites, this scent is light, fresh, and floral. Fresh, citrus-y fruit and light floral are the main notes I notice in this perfume. I love this for everyday wear. It's my favorite scent from Philosophy I've smelled so far. I'd like to get it in the body wash and lotion as well. Try it out, it's definitely an easy to wear fragrance!	positif
341	6089831	I am so in love with this fragrance. I'm normally super picky about what fragrance I wear, but wow! I can't get enough of this scent. It's so girly and sexy and fresh smelling. It's a scent that lingers for a really long time, which is what I look for in a perfume. I would definitely recommend this to a friend! I received this fragrance complimentary from Influenster, this is my honest review.	positif
342	19734272	best fragrance ever! floral perfection I absolutely love this scent. I’ve never been into perfume, I couldn’t understand why anyone would pay a high price just for a scent. I got a sample of both Saint and Sinner in my sephora play a while back and while i think Sinner is absolutely dreadful, Saint is the best perfume I’ve ever smelled! I purchased the travel bottle and will absolutely purchase the full size when the time comes. It lasts on my skin throughout the day.	positif
343	6076819	I ended up really liking the scent evolution of this perfume. While it does smell strongly of patchouli for a while after you first apply it, it does dry down into a complex and pleasant fragrance. I'm not sure how spicy it is, but it is definitely bolder than it's Saint counterpart, with a deeper, more musky scent. I really enjoyed the wood notes, and especially the combined smell of both Saint and Sinner. I received both Saint and Sinner complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review.	positif
344	11085687	I LOVE THIS PERFUME!! The scent is so light and floral I wear this during the day and also when I go out a night. I bought Kiss by Prada in ultra. This is a long lasting scent I spritz a little on in the morning and by bed time I could still smell the fragrance on me very strongly. I have already bought this fragrance 2 times and it is almost time for me to restock it!! I would highly recommend this perfume.	positif
345	5085050	My boyfriend just got me a bottle today. For a man he has a really great nose. I expected it to be for an older woman, but this scent can be worn by any age. When i buy fragrances i want them to last. I like to be able to smell the sweet aroma all day. I have never had a perfume last as long as this one. The longer i have it on the sweeter the scent seems to become. I am extremely pleased and a little obsessed lol.	positif
346	6249036	I wouldn't have previously considered a Chloe fragrance but this blew me away! A fresh, feminine scent that will see you through from day to night. I've had many comments from people asking which perfume I'm wearing. The scent is long lasting, I love that I can still smell it on my clothes at the end of a busy day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
347	5164350	I'm not the best at describing notes, but this is such a lovely, soft & slightly sweet scent. I definitely smell the vanilla in it and I've worn this for several years. I do want to emphasize that the perfume is to me, a better scent. It is longer-lasting but it also is slightly different on me. I am in love and I will wear this fragrance (the Parfum version) FOREVER!! I get a ton of compliments when I wear it and it is so long-lasting. LOVE!	positif
348	4792602	Ralph Lauren's Tender Romance fragrance is one of the best perfumes I've ever tried. The scent is beautiful. It's so feminine and romantic. It's warm and inviting. The scent lingers for a great amount of time, so throughout the day you can continue to smell it on your skin. I can't say enough how beautiful I think this perfume smells. I did receive a sample of this complimentary from Influenster, but the thoughts and opinions stated here are solely my own. I will be telling all my family and friends about this perfume!	positif
349	4802146	This fragrance has a sweet, but tangy scent. It smells delightful. Its light scent is perfect for date night or just a regular day at work. It does not have an over powering smell like many perfumes, but smells just vibrantly enough. I wore this fragrance to a concert and it lasted all night, and the smell did not change as I wore it. I recommend this fragrance to anyone who is attracted to floral scents that are not too strong. I tested this product for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own and not affiliated with Influenster.	positif
350	6074467	good value. I loved this fragrance because of the overall smell and how long it lasted! Usually my deodorant overpowers my perfume by the end of the day but not with this Ralph Lauren scent! I prefer a floral scent more than anything and this certainly had those tones! I'd also call it a bit fruity as well! Definitely very feminine! Please note I did receive this product for free from Ralph Lauren for my unbiased review!	positif
351	10533864	Got sent this perfume as a VoxBox, loved the packaging! This is the first Ralph Lauren fragrance that I have tried and I truly love it. It is a sweet, floral scent that lingers on your skin. I had my boyfriend smell it as well and he was very impressed and would like me to wear it for date nights. I look forward to using this perfume and seeing how the scent changes after a few hours of going out, but I anticipate liking it. May potentially purchase a full size when this bottle is done.	positif
352	15129514	This is the perfect summer fragrance! I love it so so much. It is sweet but not too sweet and sexy but not too sexy - not a musk scent at all. I don't know the actual florals used in the scent, but to me it smells like a great day at the beach followed by a chill dinner, drinks and dancing. Who wouldn't want to have that in a perfume? It is very well priced and one spritz is the perfect amount.	positif
353	25331978	The best oud fragrance Last very long on my skin. Absolutely love the scent. Gets me the best complements. I love oud scent but most people think its strong. But this one has a perfect balance and doesn't offend anyone. I spent the night with my partner and next day their sheets were smelling like this perfume, so it doesn't make sense when people say it doesn't last long. If you have this, you don't need any other cologne.	positif
354	19702559	Sexual Summer Scent This is your perfect summer scent without wearing a perfume that smells too strong in the heat. It’s not hard to imagine you’re a celebrity with sexy glowing bronze skin when you wear this, even if you’re borderline albino like myself. It’s not heavy, which is perfect for hot days! I love this fragrance, and I think this dry oil spray is the best version of it!	positif
355	5040016	I have around 40 perfumes, many I love but none that made me fall in love like this one-it's perfection. On my skin the vanilla bourbon and praline warmth really come out balanced by a not too sweet raspberry-it's the perfect warm and sensual cozy fragrance I am pulled to at this time of year. A+++. Although I completely disagree with the Prada Candy similarity stated below, I detest that scent, it turns sour and sharp on me, I don't smell the similarity to this one. This scent also lasts all day, love it!	positif
356	15302031	This new fragrance is another delight from Marc Jacobs. I own the original Decadence perfume and this is like a lighter more feminine version. It's great for everyday wear . I wore this to work and going out and found it suitable for both. The scent lasts really well throughout the day . It smells summery & slightly sweet and the bottle is as beautiful as the scent , Think I have found my new favourite perfume . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
357	19783882	My favorite scent from bath and body works and I just love this perfume. Sweet smell for a reasonable price. This is a definite high quality perfume and it sets the mode right for any occasion and any outfit you pair it with. It's not an overdone smell it's a classy and sweet scent. Recommend for those who want to add a hint of sweetness to match their classy or sassy for all occasions. Also, for the best results get the entire pink chiffon set (it's worth it!) Bath Body Works Pink Chiffon Fine Fragrance Mist	positif
358	19700154	Lovely scent but lacks staying power This is a tricky fragrance for me. I was super excited to get it and the actual scent did not disappoint This perfume smells exactly like fresh roses. It's girly and sweet and all things wonderful for those of us who love rose. The problem is the staying power or lack thereof . Like my other Jo Malone fragrance this one fades faster then I'd hoped and at $135 a bottle it should stick around longer.	positif
359	7839574	This fragrance smells like heaven on earth. It is rich and smells so unique. I love this perfume and will always recommend it to people, whenever I wear it I get stopped by people asking what perfume I have on. It's my go to day or night scent	positif
360	17903425	Love this very girly perfume, heavy floral fragrance, perfect for when you've got to attend a posh do or just feel like smelling glamorous! Bottle is cute but does not lend too well to an edge as is not fully stable. On my second bottle and do enjoy the scent.	positif
361	15144497	The smell of this perfume is incredible! I've always loved smoky, cologne like fragrances and this is everything I could have imagined! It's it the perfect combo of sweet and dark and I wear it daily! Forever my favorite fragrance, you could even call it my signature scent!	positif
362	5203683	This reminds me of the Stella McCartney Pop perfume. It smells almost identical but Bonbon is less sweet, a little less fruity/more floral, and I think more mature. This is a fun fragrance that I think could be a nice everyday scent but it can also be worn out.	positif
363	7840013	I love love love this scent! It is a sweet smelling fragrance that lasts all day. Being from Lancôme it can be a little pricey but well worth it...I've gotten so many compliments on this perfume. I definitely plan to re-up on this when it runs out.	positif
364	7840035	"La Vie Est Belle is my ""signature"" fragrance! Everything I own smells like this perfume, it's such a beautiful, not too floral scent, with bottom notes of patchouli and amber. I get the set with the lotion and shower gel, both work well and do not give me a rash, like some scented bath products"	positif
365	18215533	Love this fragrance a lot. The scent is very sweet and strong meaning that you really don’t need to use a lot of perfume to smell great. Absolutely love this and always request it on Christmas, Birthdays etc	positif

367	18416175	Pleasures has a very floral high scent that last long on your skin. It smells so differently on everyone, it's a nice feminine fragrance. The bottle lasts a while, you can't over spray this perfume. Smells pleasant either way.	positif
368	19675615	Dior Poison Girl This perfume has a very fun scent. Great for Spring I believe. I received this in a few samples, and just loved it! Some fragrances just get in your head and make you smile. And this did just that, so much so, I bought the bottle. Smells delicious!	positif
369	11997657	A much loved perfume, but in the shower! It smells fantastic of course, and lingers on the skin. The bottle is pretty luxe and looks lovely in the shower. Th scent lasts a little while, and makes a great base for the fragrance itself. If you love Poison, get this!	positif

371	13869419	The fragrance of this perfume is absolutely incredible. The scent can be smelled from miles away and stays for a really long time. It's amazing. Definitely needs to be tested out in real life because words can't do justice. I would buy this over and over again.	positif
372	16348799	I absolutely loveeeeee this fragrance!!! This is definitely my signature scent! I verytime I wear it I have both men and women rave about how good I smell.

374	7818527	This is my holy grail. I wear it everyday and it is the only fragrance I have ever worn since I first started wearing perfume in middle school. I kid you not I get at least 3 compliments everyday on this scent and it smells so amazing. definitely buy, you will not regret it.	positif
375	17292574	STRONG! With this perfume, a little goes a long way. It will last all day. You do not have to worry about this scent fading away. I am a first time user. It could be a little more feminine smelling. I am a fan of floral fragrances, but some people prefer more mature scents.	positif
376	16566163	Chanel Chance is my go-to fragrance scent! Love the smell so much I had to go and get the body cream. Not only does this smell just like the perfume, it literally melts into your skin and it feels soooo velvety soft and satin! LOVE IT, definitely recommend.	positif
377	15667734	This really is the best perfume out there! I get a ton of compliments every time I wear this perfume! It smells so wonderful and it's definitely my go to fragrance! I would recommend it to anyone because it the perfect scent for any occasion!!!	positif
378	9035054	My most favorite fragrance ever! This perfume oil stays in place and smells divine. Do not get on your clothes as it will leave a mark since it is an oil. Even when I try to use another brand/scent, I always come back to this classic and have for years!	positif
379	7969297	Very strong fragrance/scent but it is a pleasant one and not overly perfumey - smells fresh! I would not overdo the dry shampoo because it can weigh your hair down and make matters worse but good for freshening up before you leave the house when you don't feel like shampooing.	positif
380	15228817	This scent is gorgeous. It smells so sexy and feminine. It is extremely long lasting. I love when you can smell a hint of your perfume throughout the whole day. I'm happy with the high quality fragrance!	positif
381	23969337	Paco Rabanne Olympéa Eau de Parfum Spray is a very nice fragrance. I have seen a lot of good reviews about it and wanted to have one for awhile. When I finally got it, I thought the reviews were right. This perfume is awesome! First of all, the bottle is gorgeous! The copper tone adds such a nice touch to the orange-brown color of the fragrance itself. The bottle design makes it seems like it’s a treasure from a castle or something. I love it! What a great addition to my perfume collection. About the scent, it has a warm feeling to it. It’s sort of a sweet scent. I smell a little vanilla-ish in it. If you like sweet scent, go for it and you won’t regret. The scent is kind of strong though so please keep that in mind.	positif

388	19035888	Dolce & Gabbana The One is another one of my go to fragrances. It smells better than most perfumes. It has a musky kind of scent and is in a cute little square bottle. The only improvement I can think of is lowering the price a little.	positif
389	12417705	The perfume's smell is like the vibrant, elegant top notes of grapefruit, coriander, and basil reveal the oriental spicy signature of the fragrance. The heart of the scent captivates with its masculinity as warm ginger and cardamom work alongside charming sweet orange blossom.	positif

397	6090137	Kat nailed the light, floral scent with this fragrance. It stays on all day even though it's a subtle smell which is nice to have during the summer. Sinner smells good too but I think that saint is the perfect perfume that you can wear all day, for any occasion.	positif

399	22706507	Beautiful Packaging & Fragrance I’m not much of a perfume person. However, I have a small bottle from when KVD first released this fragrance. I was ecstatic when she was rereleasing then again. The detailed bottle is dark & intricate and the fragrance still smells of that musk, spicy scent.	positif
400	10908909	This is my everyday fragrance. It has a great light and flowery smell. It wasn't too pricey between $30-$55 and it sits very well on your natural scent. The smell lasts all day and I would recommend to the perfume enthusiast.	positif
401	18366247	There’s definitely a reason this perfume is so popular! It smells beautiful, long lasting, and I️ get so many compliments about how I️ smell when I️ wear it. It is a pretty strong fragrance though, so I️ wouldn’t recommend it if you prefer a more subtle scent.	positif

416	15104448	Escada's Joyful perfume is pleasant, floral and sweet. It smells traditionally feminine and youthful in ways that I prefer for fragrances; however, it's not so syrupy that it seems infantile. Wish it lasted a little longer, but a great scent.	positif
417	25791762	I tried out the EDP version of this scent and thought that it smelled amazing, but was a little too strong for my personal taste (as well as quite pricy). I prefer someone to only smell my perfume while hugging me, but not from more than a few feet away. This body spray gives me just as good scent and staying power than any other EDP that I own. My best advice for those who find it does not last is to spray it directly onto your body! It lasts much longer on your skin rather than your clothes. Plus, at least for me, the scent mixes with my own body chemistry to make a wonderful sweet, sexy, and more complex blend than any other vanilla fragrance. I've been wearing this for a few weeks now, and fall more in love with the scent each day.	positif
418	24303321	I liked this one too although the scent isn’t an every day perfume it’s a little stronger so it’s more of a special occasion or special event fragrance because the smell would get annoying to wear daily	positif

421	17578968	Amazing. A box of surprise I must say. Every fragrance smells amazing, lasts all day and is perfect if your travelling.

432	18606446	This perfume is glorious. I didn't like the original because it smelled too old. This is a more youthful fragrance, but mature. I get compliments whenever I wear it and it lasts all day. I think this might be my new signature scent. It's seductive, yet flirty and I love it.	positif
433	4816494	great. I wanted a new fragrance BUT did not want to smell like everyone else. Buying a roller perfume is a great way to test out a fragrance without a big investment of cash. This is a great scent not over whelming good for day time or a night out. Easy to carry with you love this	positif
434	7838564	This perfume is my go-to fragrance. I knew from the time I smelled it in store that I loved it. The scent is perfect for the night out or just to spice up your everyday style. I think they nailed this fragrance head on. Therefore, I'd definitely recommend this Perfume!	positif
435	7838932	Black Opium is a warm, spicy scent that's great for a date night in the fall. The vanilla and coffee notes smell great, but Black Opium doesn't seem appropriate for everyday wear or spring/summer wear. If you like fragrances with vanilla and spice, you'll love this perfume.	positif
436	7839423	An amazing perfume, smells great. An everyday scent, this perfume comes in a gorgeous bottle with black and sparkles! I personally have never smelt a perfume like this this is my all time favorite. Although it is a little pricey compared to other fragrances!	positif
437	7840536	Love this scent! It is very fresh- which are my favourite fragrances- but it's also suitable for nights out as well! Makes me feel confident and I love it because there is nothing else on the market that smells the same! It's definitely a staple in any perfume lovers collection	positif
438	7844635	This perfume is worth every penny and when I mean penny I mean penny because it has the most amazing fragrance my brother always wears this scent and it smells heavenly. Purchase this trust me you will not regret this ?	positif
439	25936230	What a gorgeous fragrance! I want a bigger bottle of this perfume! It stays on your skin all day! It’s got a sweet smell! This is my first time smelling this scent and I would like to use it more. Highly recommend ????	positif
440	14813128	This fragrance is so delicate and feminine. It makes me feel like a flower in spring. It is one of the best perfumes that I have ever used or smelled. I would refer this to both family and friends. It is a scent that my husband as well enjoys!!!!!!	positif
441	18583889	“Y” from Yves Saint Laurent is undoubtably a win for the brand. I’ll never say that I’m a fragrance expert. I will say that I know what smells good no matter if it’s men’s cologne or women’s perfume. My nose can always detect an immaculate scent with almost perfect accuracy. Now in regards to “Y”. I must say that it will soon be a part of my weekly rotation. It’s a scent like no other, literally. I tried to think of something to compare it to but just couldn’t do it. It feels like they really took their time to get this one right. I wore the scent to work and was given compliments by people I’ve never spoken to before. Is this the 1st “social scent”? Lol, jk. But, if I see YSL using that term in their marketing I’ll be very upset. The sage and ginger notes really stick out to me when I put it on. A really great blend. I received the product free from Yves Saint Laurent.	positif
442	22749066	Never have I had so many compliments on a fragrance! This perfume smells so divine. The scent lasts forever on the skin too and can still smell it at the end of the day! My fave. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
443	22749344	I received a sample of this perfume a week ago & Km in love! It's such a beautiful smelling fragrance, not to heavy in scent & last all day! Perfect for everyday or an evening out! A must purchase x [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
444	4871829	this scent is absolutely perfect for spring time - the floral accents are stunning and you can really smell the jasmine in the fragrance. it also lasts all day, an amazing bonus! i received this perfume as a free sample, but all opinions are my own	positif
445	4871856	I received a sample from Influenster and all opinions are my own. This fragrance has a very elegant and mature scent. It isn't my favorite as I like lighter scents but if you like a very floral and elegant smell. This is the perfume for you.	positif
446	4852768	I received this product as a sample along with the flowerbomb Fragrance. Just a tiny drop of this oil first than the fragrance and it keeps you fresh and completely satisfied with the scent. I work 9 hours and I still smell fresh when I returned home. Definitely a great product for perfume lovers.	positif
447	6211401	I received a sample of this from Viktor & Rolf and the Rose Twist layering oil is a very beautiful rose scent when used alone. It's exactly what you expect to smell when taking a whiff of a large rose bouquet. It is subtle scent which I prefer. I want someone to smell my fragrance when they are perhaps giving me a hug, not before I enter the room. Then after some time it does lose the stronger rose notes and settles to a more floral bouquet which is still quite nice and lasts for hours. I do not like the combination of Rose Twist and Flowerbomb perfume. The two combined have a powdery rose scent that I do not care for. You can still smell the rose but some how I can smell more of a baby powder scent and that is the strongest note and it lingers. I had to knock off a star due to the unfortunate smell of the combination of the two. It just isn't for me. Five stars if this was meant to be worn alone.	positif
448	7824947	Flowerbomb is THE BOMB.One of my absolute favorite fragrances. As soon as my friends smell it on me, the inquire what the scent is. I switch up my perfumes frequently, but this one is always in my arsenal. It IS expensive, but worth the cost.	positif
449	7825366	"If you're looking for a long-lasting perfume that smells really good and is perfect for any occasion then this is the product for you. When I first came across this particular scent I was in the mall with some friends and we just so happen to walk into a fragrance store called Perfumania and the sells lady just walked up to us and said, ""You're a sweet but floral kind of scent girl, right?"" I was like yea but also fruity scents as well, so she showed all the floral and fruity scents but she recommended Flowerbomb and said it was a fan favorite. Oh my GOD! The smell was like heaven and I couldn't stop smelling. Long story short, I bought two bottles of it and never looked back. It is now my signature scent. At the time they was having a 70% off sale going on, otherwise I would have never paid $100 or more for any perfume. It is a little bit on the pricey side, so if you're not sure about the product all the way their are plenty of companies, for example, ScentBird who offers these designer perfumes for a low-low price. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and stranger to try it at least once."	positif
450	7825426	I love this perfume not only for the bottle and packaging but the scent is a subtle floral smell that just smells wonderful. I got this from the Viktor & Rolf Influenster box along with the new Precious Oils that you can layer with the fragrance. I love it better with the Precious Oils!	positif
451	10549004	FLOWERBOMB is my favorite fragrance! The sweet candy and floral scent is just amazing. The soft oil adds longevity when paired with the perfume. The oil is perfect for long lasting wear! I recommend the oil to everyone who loves sweet and light smelling fragrances.	positif
452	24145443	One of my absolute favourite fragrances! Perfect for a night out. Love the warm, caramel scent. Very long lasting. Can still smell on myself and clothing the following morning. Expensive but not the most expensive perfume I own. I have repurchased this twice already and will soon be ordering my 3rd 100ml bottle	positif
453	14301029	This is my all time favorite fragrance it is my signature scent and lasts all day on my skin and i love the change in smell it goes through the day i have found its the only perfume that lasts all day on me and i love how it smells so warm and cosy and femine	positif
454	20184145	Definitely one of my favorite perfumes, If you arent looking for a really strong scent, then this fragrance is for you. I love how it smells like a date night out, But also perfect for every day wear ????	positif
455	6183271	Fragrance is difficult to review because one person may hate this and another may love it. But for me, this is a big time love of mine. It's a clean, manly smell. The scent lingers and I can even wake up the next morning and smell it. Yes it's pricey but this is a great perfume	positif
456	5259791	good value, long lasting. This is the most delicious, sophisticated, pretty smelling gourmand scent in the world. This is one of my favorite fragrances, and I only love like... 8 perfumes. So this is really special. Men love this, they will fall in love with you if you wear this.	positif
457	23327963	I finally found the one ! I received a sample of this fragrance with my coco mademoiselle. after smelling both fragrances, the coco went back. this perfume immediately gives me that sweet scent I crave, but not too sweet! this lasted about 8 hours for me which is great! glad I bought the big bottle!	positif
458	10879940	I've been wearing this fragrance for about a year. I always get compliments when wearing it. It's a scent that I have not tired of.I am very happy with the perfume. It lasts all day and smells wonderful.	positif
459	18244760	I highly recommend this product. You get to try some Lancôme premiere fragrances. Lancôme has the best perfumes they smell good and last all day. My signature scent is La Vie Est Belle it is so delicious! People always ask what I am wearing.	positif
460	23797735	This perfume smells so good. Nice sweet scent, but not sickly sweet. Fragrance is long lasting. The Eau de Parfum is longer lasting though. More expensive than some perfumes but good value. The bottle is nice too. Would recommend.	positif
461	17533988	I worked at a fragrance counter and this is the best smelling perfume from Estee Lauder. This would be the only modern muse to ever sell. It's a really flowery scent and its very potent. It's so clean smelling. Love it.	positif
462	16813051	I was reading reviews for Poison Girl on Fragrantica and a lot of them are very deragotory towards this scent saying it shouldnt be in the Poison family etc etc etc. I love this little fragrance. I mean yeah its been done before but that does not detract from what a lovely scent this is. Its a very warm and creamey scent. Like a creamsicle. I can detect the almonds very well. Poison Girl makes me think i have lightly sprinkled myself with rice krispies cocoa puff cereal. I can imagine tinker bell smelling like this while she flits around leaving a lovely trail of orange, roses, vanilla, and almonds. Also, i think the bottle is lovely too. Lovely shades of pinks and reds all coalescing in twists and turns all the way up to the cap of the bottle. An innocent demure lovely scent that should be part of your precious perfume collection.	positif
463	10540089	a signature fragrance from DIOR. It smelled really good and very long lasting. It is suitable for everyday use as the scent is very pleasing. it is a bit pricey but lasts a really long time and not to mention the bottle is very well made. I would recommend the perfume.	positif
464	10540121	This has a light sweet floral scent. More sugary sweet than flowery in my opinion. Smells lovely and isn't over powering like some other fragrances. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to meet in the middle between flower and food scented perfumes.	positif
465	10540412	All the miss Dior perfumes smell so good. The packaging is gorgeous and so classy. This has a very wonderful scent a little musky but still light and feminine. I really recommend smelling this at your local fragrance stores	positif
466	10552417	My second favourite perfume which will one day be my wedding fragrance! Such a strong sweet scent but also sexy and not to over powering. Lasts so long on your skin even when you cant smell it everyone else can and when the wind hits you smell a hint.	positif
467	10553458	The most amazing perfume I've ever used!!! The scent is very sweet, delicious and last for hours. Even after you wash your clothes you can still smell the a light fragrance of the perfume. Dior has done a marvelous job with this perfume!	positif
468	17080703	This is 1 of my absolute favorite fragrances! It has a sexy, beautiful, sophisticated scent! This is my 3rd bottle of Jadore, it is expensive but I will keep on purchasing it as there is no other perfume that quite smells like it which I love!	positif
469	10845865	I love this perfume, you can wear it to work and then to dinner after and still smell wonderful without reapplying the fragrance! I get so many compliments with Dior! This is a scent you'll be remembered by for sure!	positif

472	16730650	One of the most beautiful women's perfumes provided by Dior, will pay your partner for madness and love the smell of your perfume. Pure fragrance and values, represents complete innocence with the scent of jasmine, patchouli and mandarin. 	positif
473	17801717	I love classy, clean scents. Christian Dior has beautiful fragrances that i really like. it's not too light or to strong it's perfect. I always get compliments when i'm wearing that perfume. It stands out and the smell does not wear off. it's an all day scent. 	positif
474	4990176	Oh boy. Now I am a HUGE fan of luxury perfume, and I have bought many bottles, however, I have never been able to find a signature scent. With Coco Mademoiselle, I think my search has finally come to an end. So many scents are great initially, but their lasting power isn't there or the notes when dried down take on a completely different smell. This perfume has it all. A beautiful, classic, yet still youthful, feminine scent, and the lasting power is absolutely top notch. With most perfumes, I have to use 5 or 6 + sprays in order for the scent to last until lunch time. With this, a few light sprays on the pressure points will last all day. It's incredible. I had no intention of buying this perfume at first, and I usually steer clear of Chanel fragrances because they can be extremely over powering and very mature smelling, if you catch my drift, but I sprayed this on a whim in the store, and for the next day I couldn't think about anything else. I smelled so expensive! This fragrance is divine. It makes me feel like I can take over the world. New signature scent.	positif
475	5001335	I have been holding off on getting this perfume for a few years, because every time I tried it I felt guilty for smelling so good. It sounds ridiculous but totally true — this scent is intoxicating, and I've yet to find another fragrance that comes close. I'll definitely be repurchasing this.	positif
476	7819464	This fragrance is beautiful if you love that not too fruity scent like most people do, don't get me wrong I like fruity smells but I feel as though this would be the perfume you would use if you were to go out on a date or etc.	positif
477	7819476	a very elegant super soft scent and fragranceI buy it once and still have much hard I have the fragranceif you recommend and more young girls porq is a smell that goes with themif it is an expensive perfume but worth acquire itif you buy it for a second time	positif
478	7819663	This is my new favorite fragrance. All you really need is one or two squirts because it does have a stronger smell. The packaging is really pretty and of course the bottle is beautiful. I love Chanel perfume and this new scent is now my favorite. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a new fragrance!	positif
479	10515355	Omg i love this fragrance! I pretty much love anything by Chanel, but their perfumes are so bomb! They smell amazing, so fresh and breezy, very clean scent. Absolutely love this!! Lasts all day too without having to reapply.	positif
480	10515721	I love this fragrance. Every time I wear it I get lots of compliments. It is a very light and clean scent. Chanel perfumes are a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. I can still smell this on me at the end of the day.	positif
481	10516320	The fragrance is very smooth and pleasant, i am very sensitive with smells and if its to strong of a scent it goves me a headache. But Chance by Chanel is my favorite perfume and the smell last forever.	positif
482	17079235	I have loved this perfume for years. It always smells amazing, the scent lasts, it’s not over powering. It’s perfect. The other fragrances in this chance collection I don’t love as much. I would buy this perfume a million times!	positif
483	16459688	This perfume is the best fragrance available! It has a sweet undertone but overall is a very sophisticated scent. I could literally smell like this 24/7 and not care! My only issue is that it does not last as long as I'd hope for the price. Only last about an hour for me.	positif
484	17292127	The Allure line of fragrances by Chanel are by far my favorites & layering this lotion it's the accompanying perfume exceeds its staying power extensively. It's a beautiful lotion with a light scent of the original perfume allows you to still smell like your favorite perfume when you don't want to go full on gorgeous smelling.	positif
485	24371936	This is a wonderful product! I love the smell of the perfume and showering with the scent just makes you and the whole bathroom smell great! It's a fantastic product for special occasions and before events as it leaves you feeling delicately fragranced and leaves your skin nice and soft.	positif
486	18148168	I absolutely love the way this perfume smells. It is so refreshing and has a powdery scent to it and it just makes you over all smelled very good. I get lots of compliments on this fragrance it’s a bit expensive but it is well worth it.	positif
487	7814469	Best fragrance for men! My fiancé loved it and it has a long lasting scent. Compared to other perfumes this one is not a cheap smell. It will last and its not to strong either so you can enjoy it. I bought mine at Utla for a great price since they had a sale going on.	positif
488	7836416	I love this perfume! Wish it came in a larger size. I am always running out since it smells so beautiful.I always am complimented on the scent. This is hands down my absolute favorite fragrance!!!	positif
489	10543935	Giorgio Armani Si is by far my absolute favorite scent. My loving husband got it for me for Christmas last year. I had been stalking the perfume counter for a few months. The balance of sweet/spicy is my signature smell choice. Armani Si has it covered. Very sexy fragrance?	positif
490	4724318	I get headaches very easily by strong scents especially perfumes. I love how light and pretty this fragrance smells and feels on. I don't feel overwhelmed from the scent and it never gets old Or tiring.	positif
491	5089630	buildable coverage, natural looking radiance!, covers well.. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. I am constantly looking for a beautiful, radiant glow without the headlights look. This is ideal and my skin looks very healthy.The coverage is light which I did not expect to like. But, my skin looks so natural that I love it.Next month I ill be 68 years young. Yikes!!! All my life I had oily skin, but am now dry. I suppose this is why I love this balm. I do not have dry, flaky skin, but it is dry.I also have a super scent picker-upper. I can smell things most people don't even notice. Yet, I don't find any scent in this balm. People have complained about the scent. I do NOT like any skin care products or cosmetics with a fragrance. I like to leave my fragrance to my perfume!! :) In any event, I do not detect any scent in this at all.PS: I have never been a big Estee fan. It's ok, but there are other brands I prefer. Well, I am hooked on this Estee product for sure!	positif
492	16730640	I am very picky about my fragrances, and after searching high and low for a new perfume I stumbled across Versace Crystal Noir. It is my favorite fragrance I have ever smelled! This unique, beautiful scent gets me compliments every time I wear it. I can't wait to buy more!	positif
493	17297148	Love the fragrance. My husband has bought this for me several times. The lotion smells very similar to the fragrance but not exact. For some reason it became liquidy after months and I didn't really feel like it was meant for the skin more for smell purposes only. Perfume has a nice scent, fresh yet classy	positif
494	18259435	I absolutely love this scent. I spent about an hour at Sephora going through all the fragrances and this was the winner. It is expensive but completely comparable to other perfumes. I got compliments everywhere I went about how good it smelled. Would buy again	positif
495	23321555	Everything I’ve Been Looking For in a Perfume My boyfriend wears Versace Dylan Blue Por Homme, so when this companion fragrance was released, it’s safe to say I was quite intrigued! I was nervous about blind-buying a scent, so I visited a Sephora location to test it in person. Upon first spraying the perfume, I was enveloped by citrus, perfect for the upcoming spring and summer seasons. As the perfume dried down and mixed with my body chemistry, it became even more intoxicating to me—floral, but with a woody, mysterious quality that I can’t quite explain. Even my boyfriend, who is partial to sweet gourmands, was a big fan of this scent on me! In addition to the beautiful, unique scent of the perfume itself, the lasting power is incredible. I wore it for eight hours straight, and even after my nightly shower, I could still smell the fragrance on my pressure points. The quality is everything you’d expect and more from a brand like Versace! Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a new scent.	positif
496	23183577	I love the smell of this. Not at all “old lady” smelling like some rose fragrances. Have received compliments on my perfume from both makes and females. Has the rose hint without it being over powering. A lovely summery scent that I will without doubt be buying again	positif
497	23969344	Absolutely love this fragrance! I’m usually really fussy with my perfumes and never try anything new but this is gorgeous. I could smell it on myself all day and a little goes a long way in terms of scent.	positif
498	14383148	Definitely my favorite man perfume, I love the smell and stays for a lot of hours in the person, it is very rich and intense. My brother had it and really became my favorite fragrance of men. I love to feel his scent in others person becouse It transports me to another place.	positif
499	16347417	very feminine scent. smell last all day and the product has last me for months now. I would recommend this as a gift for someone's mom or for someone's girlfriend. for being the first fragrance by narciso rodriguez I have to give 2 thumbs up for making such a lovely perfume.	positif

512	18801683	After years and years of using this scent, i would still choose it over any other perfume. It smells fresh and lasts for a very long time. Its a little pricey but I think all fragrances are. It comes in a clear bottle with light blue cap. I love it and buy it regularly.	positif
513	10966505	I'm a fan of this fragrance. It is not your typical feminine perfume. It is fresh and aquatic, hence the name cool water. It is fresh without smelling masculine. It has decent lasting power. Great everyday scent.Notes: Top- MelonMiddle- LotusBase- Musk	positif
514	22558225	Like a warm, summer day..with a smell of sansalt in the ocean from a distance.you will want to put on your swimsuitn on amd emjoy the day.the fragrance has been out of a while. Due to the warm, sunny scent . Its a true go to perfume in the summer.	positif
515	18514510	This is actually quite nice. I am very sensitive to smells and a lot of perfumes can give me a headache or actually make me physically ill. If it wasn't for the rose scent this is one I would consider buying...I usually buy lighter fruity fragrances.	positif
516	15048085	I brought this on sale, so a good price for such a good smelling fragrances perfume. Is long lasting and really nice when you get a hint of the scent throughout the day. I love the packaging. I really good buy for me!	positif
517	14302482	A light refreshing scent. Gives you that clean smell like just out of the shower. It is long lasting fragrance and makes a me want to try other philosophy perfumes. I purchased this off of qvc and it was available for a great price. I would definitely purchase this again!	positif
518	14302565	I consider this my signature scent. No other perfume has ever topped this one. The notes are blackberry and vanilla but it translates into a fragrance that is so unique. I get compliments daily on how good I smell!	positif
519	6089409	I received this complimentary through influenster along with the sinner scent. It smells great, I love the fragrance, my only problem is that the scene does not linger, it seems to go away in a very short period of time like spray rather than perfume. It has a wonderful smell though.	positif
520	6183912	smells so good!. I received the Saint & Sinner fragrances complimentary for review purposes; I looooved this scent! I had the chance to try the sinner perfume as well and I love it just as much. The smell is very feminine and attractive!	positif
521	6218939	long lasting, great smell. I was pleasantly surprised with the spicy, yet subtle scent of this perfume. I received a sample of this perfume, along with Kat Von D Saint, complimentary for review purposes from Influenster. I was expecting to like the Saint perfume better, as I usually prefer softer, sweeter scents and am generally averse to patchouli, so I figured the vanilla/caramel/sandalwood notes in Saint would be right up my alley. However, I found Saint to be a little more musky than I preferred and figured I would give Sinner a try. When I first smelled and applied the Sinner perfume, I wasn't a huge fan because it was just so bold and in your face. But surprisingly, after Sinner had a chance to soak in and meld with my skin chemistry, the scent that developed was still spicy, but somehow much more soft and subtly sexy. Not only did I like the way the fragrance adapted to my skin, but the scent lasted ALL DAY and I received so many compliments! This warm, spicy scent is my new go to fragrance for fall and winter!	positif
522	10551029	Out of Kat Von D’s Saint and Sinner perfumes, Sinner is definitely my favourite and a more complex scent than Saint. The heart of the fragrance is a mix of cinnamon, vanilla and white florals with base notes of vetiver, patchouli and wood. While I am normally drawn to fruity scents, there is just something about this that is so sultry and alluring. It smells strong at first, but once it sinks into the skin, it is the perfect blend of sweet and woodsy. Feminine. Confident. A statement scent. It reminds me of autumn, which is my favourite season. This scent definitely seems like it is best suited for a night out, but I am the type of person who would use this as an every day scent too. Sinner lasted most of the day on me. *Received the Saint & Sinner fragrances complimentary for review purposes.	positif
523	18075940	Smells so lovely, the fragrance is really light and flirty. The smell lasts all day and I get asked what kind of perfume I'm wearing often. I purchased at Sephora, the gorgeous bottle is just an added bonus because the scent is so amazing	positif
524	18076743	This perfume smells delicious! The scent is floral and fruity with a light vanilla smell. This is the first time I use this and love it as summer time fragrance. The bottle is beautiful and perfect for display! I will definitely repurchase!	positif
525	5168848	travel-friendly, scent fads quickly. I received a sample of this scent in a tiny spray bottle. I instantly fell in love with the fragrance. Warm, musky and sensual. I normally don't wear perfume but decided I had to wear this one. I must mention that when I went to the Sephora store to buy this product, she couldn't believe that I was wearing Prada as it smelled so different on me. I did purchase the rollerball and, yes, it smells the same on me as the sample. However, the scent doesn't last long at all, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. After a few hours, I don't smell the scent from the rollerball. However, I use a tiny bit from the sample spray I have yesterday morning and can still smell the fragrance this morning. I guess I'll have to invest in the spray. That said, I really love, love, love this fragrance!	positif
526	17392880	My favorite fragrance of all time, it is an expensive perfume but it is worth every penny. If you are looking to splurge on a perfume this is the one! It is long lasting and the smell is to die for. (floral/frutti scent)	positif
527	24854451	My two sons picked out this delicious smelling perfume for me and upon first use I immediately felt beautiful!!! The fragrance lifted my confidence and made my girly inner self come out stronger and more beautiful. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone who wants to feel beautiful inside and out. Wonderful scent.	positif
528	25768740	So many good smells in one! I love this perfume, one of my favorites! The scent lasts all day and the notes change as the day goes on. More of a winter or an evening fragrance...	positif
529	18158559	I received a sample of this perfume and it's scent is very feminine and floral. I liked it and plan on purchasing. I would say it smells more like I prefer as a daytime fragrance. The bottle is very pretty and would look fabulous on display.	positif
530	15078523	I'm very picky about fragrance and when I found this scent I got so excited. It smells soooo good! It's fresh and sweet and unique. The bottle is gorgeous. I love the shape and design and it's not as expensive as other perfumes.	positif
531	16797104	In love with this scent! super girly, and just smells,pretty. i dont know any perfume talk but in my opinion its the perfect everyday fragrance, i have it in a rollerball and it applies the perfect amount and it doesnt smell too strong!	positif
532	22697782	Gorgeous scent Received a sample in my Play box and I am fighting with myself because I really don’t need another perfume but I can not stop smelling myself! So fresh, vibrant and lasts long. Beautiful floral fragrance.	positif
533	23319002	New favorite perfume! I got the perfume sampler for Christmas and fell in love with this scent. So I ended up turning in my Sephora sampler card for this fragrance. It lasts all day on me and smells amazing.	positif
534	23344738	Soft, romantic, sexy, roses that truly lasts! ? My husband chose this and he was spot on. I've recently bought quite a few purse/travel sized perfumes, I have my husband catch a whiff a few days in a row of my favorites and he fell in love with this one. Thankfully I did too! The scent is definitely of roses so if you're looking for a true soft rose scent you've found it. It's also quite soft but still noticeable and has the most amazing staying power. I apply this in the morning and can still smell it at the end of the night without needing a touch up in between. I haven't found a single fragrance yet with that type of staying power. I also want to mention that I don't care what a bottle looks like, I only care about the scent itself but if you do care than this bottle is quite lovely and oh so feminine like the scent itself. It really it pretty sitting on my dresser. I also own the travel size, rollerball, it will come in handy when I don't want to risk my beautiful bottle for a weekend away.	positif
535	24676744	If you love rose scented fragrances, you’re going to love this. I bought it on a whim since I’ve bought rose scented perfumes before that ended up smelling too grandma-y but this scent is absolutely perfect. Definitely buying a full size after trying out the rollerball	positif
536	10546913	Best perfume ever! This gives women a very seductive smell! my husband says this is his favorite fragrance for a woman. this is the perfect date night scent, or even for other important events. This is a must have.	positif
537	7820460	I love this fragrance! I have both the bottle and rollerball. I usually get headaches when a perfume is too strong, and this doesn't give me headaches. I love that is fresh and light, but people can still smell it on me. I recommend if you want a fresh, light floral scent!	positif
538	7821561	I absolutely love this fragrance! This is the only bottle of perfume that I have ever purchased more than once. It has a light, sweet, floral scent that smells amazing! Everytime I wear it I get so many compliments. This fragrance is definitely a must-have.	positif
539	7821677	I love this perfume. It is so fresh and classic smelling. Daisy is one of my favorite scents. This perfume lasts all day, and the rollerball makes it easy to travel with. Daisy is a great springtime scent. It's a staple in my fragrance collection.	positif
540	7822288	I love this perfume so much that I have it in all sizes!! I love the sweet floral fragrance and it's a smell perfect for summer or all year because I wear it year round. The scent it light bit strong enough that it doesn't wear off fast.	positif
541	10529596	This is my go to fragrance! Love them smell its a way lighter smell than the original daisy much more bearable in my opinion. The bottle is so cute and the topper is adorable. I've tried different perfumes but always come back to this one my go to scent!	positif
542	10532070	This is by far my favorite fragrance. It smells fresh, unique and is has the perfect balance between fruity and floral with a light touch to it. It has an elegant and feminine scent which always makes me use it as my Go-To perfume. I just can't help but love it!	positif
543	10532349	Love this perfume, it smells amazing. It's a good daytime fragrance. It has a floral scent. You don't need to use very much. It is a good price for the quality of this perfume. I always recommend this to my friends, family, and in beauty groups online.	positif
544	10537670	I'm a die hard Marc Jacobs fan, and this is easily one of my favorite perfumes. I find his other fragrances are very heavy, but this one is light and wearable (but still decadently Marc Jacobs). Smells initially like citrus, honey and toffee, and fades into a delicate floral scent.	positif
545	10541508	This perfume smells amazing. This is like no other fragrance that i have. my boyfriend loves with scent on me , every time i wear this i get compliments. its a little pricey but worth every penny. my favorite Marc Jacobs fragrance .	positif
546	18445681	This is a lovely gift set for anyone who loves the Ginger fragrance from Origins. You get a 50ml perfume, a body wash and a body cream in the same fragrance, so you can layer the scent and smell gorgeous all over. It’s a perfect gift or a great treat for yourself.	positif
547	17081019	Such a beautiful fragrance - only require a small amount as it is a strong and long lasting scent. A deep but sweet smell. So many compliments when wearing this perfume. The bottle is also beautiful and is refillable at Debanhams which is great! Would definitely recommend	positif
548	24898918	If you are looking for a high end fragrance that lasts all day than this is for you. This has more of a musky scent that smells very warm and has some amber in it. I will put this on and still be able to smell it on me the next day. One of my favorite perfumes ever. 	positif
549	14954357	This is my ultimate signature scent. If i ask anyone that bows me what is my favorite perfume this is it. The men's Angel also smells amazing. I can't wait to try the new fragrance Aura.	positif
550	4969737	good value, travel-friendly. This fragrance is superb! Everywhere I go, it makes an impact when I walk by. Everyone asks, What perfume are your wearing? It smells so good. It has an excellent scent that lasts all day.	positif
551	15303708	This perfume is really lovely. It smells great and the bottle itself looks very high class. A wonderful addition to my fragrances. The only downfall is I don't feel it was a long lasting scent, it didn't last for too long on my skin or clothes.	positif
552	6256334	This perfume is very light and sweet smelling, it has a somewhat tropical scent about it and reminds you of summer, even in the UK! It's a perfect day to day scent but also works for a night out, it's a versatile fragrance perfect for all occasions as it's not too strong but just right for any occasion. The only downside is the scent does not seem to last all day and would need a few top ups throughout the day to keep the scent going. However it is a beautiful smelling perfume, also a lovely colour bottle and fits in nicely on my perfume shelf. (I also love the little added touch of the fabric logo on the bottle!) Overall, if you like light, floral but fruity scents that aren't too strong but smell beautiful, this one is for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
553	10565160	Euphoria for men is probably my most favorite fragrance for men, the scent stays with you all day and gives you light and fresh smell that all of my co-workers love on me. It was a purchase at a small perfume shop in our local mall and I love it!	positif
554	10565252	Love this perfume. It's a very clean smell rather than fruity. I purchased this at my local Marshalls store. The fragrance gives a very feminine scent. The only complaint is that it does not seem to stay on very long. The smell fades quicker than others I have worn.	positif
555	17938104	Love this fragrance, I’ve bought multiple bottles because I love the smell of it. The scent is sweet and very lady like. I love the shape that the perfume bottle has and would definitely recommend it to others	positif
556	10993975	I totally love Calvin Klein Eternity NIght Perfume. It smells so clean and fresh. I got more compliments wearing it than any other fragrance ever. It lasts all day but doesn't have an over powering scent. The bottle is beautiful, too. I love it and would for sure buy it again!	positif
557	11860966	Yes once again the word love i am crazy about Calvin Klein perfume this fragrance is like a statement scent its say i am here you smell me and it last forever even after you wash your clothes i love it .. Out know time for more ..	positif

I get compliments whenever I wear this. Obsession will always be a staple in my perfume collection it has been my go to fragrance for years.	positif
559	5395518	Okay, I haven't worn this perfume in a while but felt compelled to write a review because it was my everyday scent growing up. I can't even remember who or how I was introduced to it but soon as I smelled it, I got hooked! I was a junior in HS and was really attracted to somewhat strong, unique, fresh scent, and Issey Miyake was that to me. I wore it up until I started working and was able to afford to have a fragrance collection. I was able to identify with this scent so it has a special place to my heart. L'Eau d'Issey is a sharp, clean, in-your-nose type of scent and the toned-down smell as it wear down in the day is very pleasing as well. One of my favorites!	positif
560	4801979	good value. I absolutely love my Tender Romance fragrance from Ralph Lauren. I was lucky enough to get a free sample in a VoxBox from Influenster and absolutely love it! I will definitely keep buying this perfume and highly recommend it. The scent lasts all day and its got a very sweet smell.	positif
561	4874747	good value. This new fragrance is a perfect addition to your perfume collection. It can be easily worn day or night, and the scent does not get old quick. It is not too sweet and smells very luxurious. I'd definitely buy more!	positif
562	10534167	I got this in the mail to test and I was so excited! I don't typically wear perfume that much but this fragrance smells amazing! The bottle was aesthetically pleasing and the scent lasted all day. I am a huge fan and will most likely purchase a full size bottle.	positif
563	10849162	This is a great gift for any women, the smell is fantastic the scent lasts all day. It does not make you smell like you just sprayed a pound of perfume on either. It has the perfect amount of strength in the fragrance.	positif
564	10952043	Totally different from the deep musky perfumes I usually go for but just as noticeable when you're wearing it.It's a timeless fragrance which I find suitable for work or an evening out. This is a classy scent with lots going on beneath the initial fresh flowery smell.	positif
565	18406084	Has the most captivating smell . Not to strong .. highly recommended , to keep scent on for a longer period of time , oil<br />Your skin and don't rub perfume together it will mess up the balance of the fragrance	positif
566	4912920	The only reason this perfume is getting 4 stars is because the scent is amazingly gorgeous! I've never had the pleasure of visiting the French/Italian Riviera, but in my mind this is how it would smell if it had a signature scent. Beautifully clean, with a citrusy-sweet twist that is simultaneously refreshing and charmingly playful. Unfortunately, it has a very low range, in that no one besides yourself will be able to smell it once it's been sprayed on. Surprisingly, it seems to have a long-lasting effect in that you'll be able to smell whiffs every now and then, but as others have pointed out, it doesn't stay on in its true glory for very long. However, I find it great for layering purposes and I'm so in love with the fragrance itself that I am willing to overlook these shortcomings. For its higher price point though, I anticipate Tom Ford will eventually invest in figuring out a way to extend the scent's longevity. Beautiful blue bottle with gold accents, I look forward to enjoying this scent for a long time.	positif
567	4726722	Love, Love, love!It never fails, whenever I'm wearing this fragrance, I'm guaranteed compliments from both sexes. May be unable to smell scent, but trust me, it is ever present.Way to go Tom From, my favorite perfume.	positif
568	4830161	luxurious, summery. I give this perfume 5 stars simply because it is the most devine summer smell. Literally reminds me of summer in a bottle. Does have the slightly sunscreen scent -- but it works ! I know and love my summer fragrances, and this is my new favorite one!	positif
569	16658169	This is a really elegant, rich floral scent. I first smelled it in store when trying to pick out a new winter perfume - I think it works best as an evening fragrance, but I can see wearing it all day for a special occasion. It's enticing, comforting, and a more grown up floral.	positif
570	15409705	This is a great everyday perfume. It has a light airy fragrance with some floral hints. The best way to describe the smell is to say it has a sweet, floral baby powder scent. It's quite soothing and lasts hours. I feel like I always smell freshly bathed, even when I'm not.	positif
571	5449442	When I saw the release of Marc Jacobs latest Blush perfume, I just had to buy. I noticed the brand is now branching out the Daisy range into three fragrances of the Blush scent. Daisy, Daisy Eau So Fresh and Daisy Dream. Now I'm a true Marc Jacobs fan but even I was a little confused when deciding which to buy. All three scents smell slightly similar but with different degrees of fragrance subtlety. Depending on which range of scents you love will probably be your decision maker. Personally I prefer the stronger scent of Daisy Eau so fresh Blush but this one was my close call and a safe choice as a gift for someone.The fragrance of Daisy Blush is light, delicate, warm and welcoming with dewy scents of water lily and pear. The scent is very much a Marc Jacobs signature scent with only a few light changes. Having said that, I truly love this fragrance and it's great as an everyday perfume with light notes that just make this fragrance perfect for spring and summer months.	positif
572	10540675	I really loved the floral fresh scent of this perfume. I'm very picky as I feel most perfumes smell overly chemical. Thanks to Influenster I got to sample it for free and have a new fragrance i love.	positif
573	25938042	I also love this scent of the perfume! It is so light but not too subtle to where you can't smell it at all! It's a beautiful fragrance and if I had enough money to purchase it for myself I totally would! 	positif
574	17079490	I really love the smell of this perfume. It's so light but bold at the same time. The scent did not wear off during the day. I would definitely recommend this fragrance to others who love a good high in perfume.	positif
575	17079557	Honestly I loved this fragrance! I received a sample in a VoxBox, and I wish I was in the market for a new perfume! It has a wonderful smell, and excellent lasting power. My friends all noticed the beautiful smell of this perfume and many asked to borrow it! I would highly recommend this scent!	positif
576	24307004	I'm not much of a perfume wearer but I will say that I tried this Vera Wang Embrace Green Tea and Pear Blossom fragrance and it smells really good. I was also surprised at how long the scent lasted throughout the day.	positif
577	24307381	I love this perfume. I received it as a sample to try and it smells amazing. I will definitely be buying this when I run out. The smell is a light clean fragrance. The scent is long lasting even in the summer!	positif
578	10550401	I absolutely love this fragrance!!! It is a very light and fliral scent. I can spray just one spritze and you can smell it for the rest of the day. I highly recommend this perfume if you like the smell of roses and flowers. Definitely one of the best ones i have seen. 	positif
579	17080852	I was honestly surprised to love this scent. Sometimes I think of Vera Wang fragrances as being too heavy and strong, but this was a very fresh and flowery smell. I love wearing this to work or just in my day to day routine. Impressed with this perfume!	positif
580	24261252	I've always been a huge fan of Vera Wang's fragrances, and this particular one is no different. If you enjoy a fragrant floral scent, then this perfume is for YOU! It has a very classic and romantic vibe to the smell, and I personally enjoyed it very much. 	positif
581	24908776	I love love loved this fragrance, the smell is so wonderful and not to heavy it’s just the right smell, is the type of scent you would love to keep smelling through out the day and people ask what perfume your are wearing.	positif
582	25935649	Not a perfume wearer often but I really enjoyed this fragrance. It’s a nicer scent that isn’t too strong or over the top. It’s a great date night wear without worrying about smelling like a grandma.	positif
583	15582746	I love the way this perfume smells! It's been my go to scent for years. It's sweet without being overly sweet and the notes of dark chocolate add a luxurious feel to the fragrance. I highly recommend this to anyone!	positif
584	5851132	Maui Fantasy is a light summery fragrance which smells of tropical fruit, light flowers and vanilla. To me, the top note is reminiscent of sweet pinepple - smelling like a fruity cocktail rather than the fresh cut fruit. It has a syrupy feeling to it. The scent remains sweet until the very end, but the floral heart notes prevent the scent from smelling sickly. To me, this perfume is the fragrance equivalent to drinking cocktails on the beach in the middle of the afternoon. It has the light, sweet and fun feeling. This isn't a sophisticated scent by any means - but it is very fun and girly. This scent is perfect for summer as it doesn't feel overly heavy, and lacks any muskiness. The perfume bottle is gorgeous -a frosted blue glass orb with a tropical flower (I want to say a frangipani but I'm no florist!) painted on the front of the bottle. This is a nice addition to Britney's Fantasy line, perfect for those who like light and fruity scents.Top Notes: Strelitzia, Passionfruit, Pink Grapefruit.Heart Notes: Hibiscus, Cyclamen, Tiare Flower, Orange Blossom.Base Notes: Coconut, Vanilla, Musk, White Amber, White Woods.	positif

586	15676486	I purchased this perfume by accident thinking it was another Hermès fragrance and totally planned on taking it back. Something inside me told me to just spray it on to see how it smelled. SO GLAD I DID!!! It smells so good. It's a more mature scent but it's definitely a new fav for me.	positif
587	19072389	These perfume samples are awesome they have a nice scent I love the bottle it's very pretty this is my go to perfume for a date night these perfume fragrances smell wonderful I honestly think these are great to travel with maybe.	positif

589	17707306	The smell is so good and they leave my skin feeling super soft. Leaves skin soft with the lovely light scent, so perfect.

591	18918916	Smells like a higher end perfume! The bottle despite being plastic looks similar to a luxury product. It smells like a mature scent. I also like that the product almost never expires. I’ve had my bottle for years without a change in fragrance.	positif

593	19674464	Great Smell I waited forever for this perfume. I love the scent and that it is just one ingredient. However, the price for a full bottle is insane. The travel spray is great but it takes a lot to get a good lasting smell. It still smells good and layers well with other fragrances.	positif
594	25862563	This is really unique and has only one scent ingredient. It doesn’t have a typical perfume smell, so I would definitely recommend trying a sample before buying, and definitely wouldn’t buy it as a gift unless I knew the person liked the fragrance already. It is a bold fragrance.	positif
595	5609649	I have the original miu miu fragrance, which I love, but I love this even more. It's a bit fresher and cleaner smelling. Perfect for a summer scent. I don't know perfume lingo so that's the best I can do. I also love that it's not over powering.	positif
596	4738316	perect. While in the store my bff picked up the fragrance and said it had a male kind of scent to it. I love perfume that smells smoky or musk. I also love that its Parfum and not toilette. +	positif
597	5215717	I'm REALLY particular when it comes to perfume (I've only used 3 fragrances in my life, including this one) but this one blew me away. It hardly even smells like perfume; it has a fresh scent and really does smell like flowers.	positif
598	14978390	This fragrance though! So in Love. Daisy is such an awesome smelling perfume.I definitely feel the money you spend for the quality and overall nasal experience is worth it. The scent is floral, but not too harsh or over powering. I would recommend this fragrance to any woman. Classic!	positif
599	19636078	I absolutely LOVE this scent. This is my new everyday fragrance. It’s one of this perfumes that the smell lingers all day long and it’s truly heavenly whenever you just get a small whiff of it throughout the day. The packaging is also super cute so brownie points!	positif
600	19636165	Perfect everyday perfume! This smells amazing!!!!!! I received a small sample size for review purposes but it was so perfect I'm purchasing the full size. It's a nice light and wearable fragrance, not a musky or heavy scent.	positif
601	19636435	This fragrance is a little strong on me, but it eventually wears down to a very pretty scent. I'm not usually a fan of Marc Jacobs perfume but this one surprised me. You may want to use a light hand until you figure out how it smells on you!	positif
602	19636630	I absolutely love this fragrance! I believe it’s of a floral scent and is extremely long lasting. I can still smell the fragrance even after my shift of 12 hours! Such a creative design! I would recommend this fragrance to everyone, especially women who love floral scented perfume	positif
603	19665407	Amazing! This fragrance is amazingly decadent, so the name is very fitting. The packaging is stunning, very unique and it sets itself apart from other perfumes. It is quality, a very nice and thick glass makes it feel more expensive and durable. The perfume itself is the perfect feminine scent. It is crisp and floral. It is one of the most long lasting perfumes that I have ever had the pleasure of wearing. When I used it the first time, I underestimated how powerful the scent was and used too much. Even after washing it off, I could still smell the perfume on my skin. When trying it the next time, I used just a few tiny drops and that lasted all day long. When I woke up in the morning, I could still smell the light, classy scent and it made my skin smell very sweet. So, with this perfume, a little bit goes a very long way and lasts a very long time, and I don't have to re-apply it throughout the day. A bottle of this will last a very long time. Definitely a very luxurious scent!	positif
604	16080209	this perfume smellllllss perfect! its such a light fragrance that is perfect to tease yourself and others with the right amount of floral scent. the packaging is also super cute. i find myself reaching for this one over the other perfumes i have!	positif

606	18057523	"I just discovered a new fragrance that smells magical, Marc Jacobs Decadence Eau So Decadent. It is a sensual and luxurious perfume with a woody scent. The woody scent mixed with flowers makes for a glamorous feel.<br />I would definitely recommend this perfume for a date night scent. It’s sexy, a little spicy and a total feeling of luxury.<br />The smell is warm, woody and carries a bouquet of flowers. That’s a combination I’m hot for!

611	22694886	Alien is one of my favorite fragrances. The hair mist smells exactly like the perfume. So warm, unique and inviting! The hair mist bottle is made of glass, very high quality and the shape/size is travel friendly. A few spritzes is all it takes, and the scent lasts all day!	positif
612	24705449	I absolutely loved this fragrance! It has a very unique smell. I have allergies and this did not affect them at all, like most other perfumes. Very good scent and every time I wore it, I received many compliments!	positif
613	15301088	A lovely smooth shaped bottle, a musk and lavender fragrance. A feminine perfume with a hint of masculine. Something different from what I would useful pick but a refreshing scent. I would recommend smells lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
614	16840781	At first I found this perfume quite floral and almost old fashioned smelling, but it did settle to quite a nice musky smell. The packaging and bottle is understated except the blue tinge of the perfume. Overall the fragrance has the scent of an expensive fresh soap. Lovely for daytime.	positif
615	17407976	I love the smell of this purfume. It is one of my absolute favorite perfumes the smell is so clean and fresh not over powering one bit. The fragrance has a soft strong scent that lasts all day and night a bottle will definitely last a while because a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product.	positif
616	16813694	This long awaited highly anticipated scent is about to be released to adoring fans of this wonderful cult-like status online beauty company. The scent is called You and the makers wanted it to smell like a girls boyfriends neck after he has been wearing cologne for eight hours. And you know what....they got it spot on. I think this fragrance has only two notes...iris and musk and they are both very evident in this perfume. I noticed the iris immediately. Its a soft cashmere sweater like fragrance that isnt too loud. Its baby a baby soft whisper and lovely and nice and powdery. It does dry down to a very mens cologne type vibe so this scent is extremely unisex leaning to masculine. Fragrantica has it listed as being for men and women which is correct. Also, the bottle is to die for. Sooooooo cute. You is a real winner amoungst mediocre department store and celebrity scents. Its almost a nich scent its that good. You is really gonna set the fragrance world on fire. Youre gonna love it.	positif
617	7837401	This is my favorite body spray ever. I like it more than my perfumes I buy. I always get multiple bottles whenever I go to the store because I love the scent so much. I can spray it all over and then spray more because the smell is not very strong. I own this entire fragrance line.	positif
618	16252041	"I purchased this body butter in the, ""A Thousand Wishes"" scent by Bath & Body works, around Christmas from a Bath & Body Works store. I smelled it and was instantly hooked. I have been a Bath & Body Works fan for years, but in recent years haven't used their lotion and body spray products that much because I find that they can be overly sweet. This fragrance, however, is a more sophisticated scent than usually offered by Bath & Body Works.It is still sweet, but not a cloying vanilla scent, a more complex layering of sweet, warm, and even a little bit of floral notes. I liked it so much that I also purchased the small perfume and wear it often. I have received many compliments on this fragrance, and people are always surprised when I tell them it is from Bath & Body Works. I hope they continue to sell it and it isn't a seasonal or limited edition scent."	positif
619	4759049	When I first smelled this fragrance I was captivated by the scent. This scent reminds me of being in a majestic field of flower. Buy it and you will see how amazing this scent can be.	positif
620	20229226	"I rotate between 3 main fragrances - sweet and approachable, classic and professional, and confident and sassy. V & R's ""Flowerbomb"" is perfect for days when I feel a little sassy or need a little confidence boost. It's slightly sharp, a little mysterious and a bit heavy, but wears well and the scent stays throughout the day. While it is called ""flower""bomb, and you could characterize the scent as sweet - I really don't. It is slightly come-hither that it borders seductive, but avoids being cloying. This perfume is a slow, sweet, Southern belle smirk (not a smile) that hints about trips to the overgrown orchard. This perfume is the subtle flirtation Scarlett O' Hara wished she mastered. It has an understated confidence about it and its a layered scent with great dimension. It's a ""full"" scent and not for those that like a ""light mist"" and out the door - this scent sticks and it carries. It is a blessing in that way, and a curse. People will smell it, and they will sniff you - whether you like it or not.The other day I had a male colleague full-out arm sniff me (went from wrist to shoulder in a long whiff) and proclaimed, ""You smell great!"" (a) creepy much? (b) It's V & R Flowerbomb!"	positif
621	5243798	This perfume is honestly perfection. It's so beautiful and delicate and feminine without being generic smelling or too floral. At first when you spray it on it is quite strong and smells very heavily of makeup-y powder. However, it dies down on the intensity level after about 10 minutes and dries down to a lovely classic sweet scent without smelling like cotton candy! It's the perfect mature sweet scent! It does make you feel almost nostalgic when you wear it, like it's an old scent from your grandma's makeup bag! With that being said, I don't find this to be an old lady scent by any means! It smells vintage, yet modern and fresh all at the same time. The only downside to this perfume I have found is that it doesn't last as long as most of the other replica fragrances (i.e. lazy sunday morning which I can still smell on me the next day even after showering and on my clothes when I wash them like a week later - crazy!) not to say this scent doesn't last a long time, it just doesn't last as long as I'd like it to. I'd say it starts fading 4-6 hours in. Overall, a wonderful beautiful fragrance and I HIGHLY recommend it!	positif
622	4978381	Recently bought this scent duty-free at Heathrow Airport in England. I loved it too much to pass it up, and was upset that Sephora didn't carry it at the time, but got it anyway. I typically like to buy all my fragrances at Sephora for the Beauty Insider points (guilty but loyal!), so I was reluctant to buy from anywhere else, but that just tells you how much I loved this scent. Prior to purchasing this, my signature scent was Giorgio Armani's Sí. I find that I tend to favor perfumes with notes of vanilla, and Olymp?a and Sí both have this in common. Whereas Sí is a warm, fruity vanilla, Olymp?a is a fresh, salty vanilla. Sí is perfect for anytime but definitely better for fall. Due to this, I set out looking for a warmer weather scent that had a bit more of a fresh feel to it but was still predominantly vanilla. Olymp?a is exactly what I was looking for in a spring and summer fragrance. I'm picky about sillage on perfumes, but this delivers, hands-down. Smells amazing, like vanilla and salt water, and lasts a surprisingly long amount of time. I find it especially lingers in my hair. Gorgeous bottle, gorgeous scent, and gorgeous product! Highly recommend for anyone who is a fan of vanilla-based perfumes. This is perfect for summer, as it has a slight beachy feel to it from the salt note, but I would wear it anytime.	positif
623	5397438	This is THE fragrance for those of you, who are seeking a fresh, peppery citrus scent. On the side note, I'm not very fond of citrus scents, because a lot of them tend to smell cheap or like a soap for the dishes but Bergamotto is by far the best citrus scent I ever tried. The blend of bergamot, citrus and ginger (which is the reason for the 'spicy/peppery' aspect of this scent) along with vetyver is marvelous and the didn't carry the musk to the excess, which is the most important thing for me personally, because I get sick of musk very fast. The only downside with this one is the lasting power, which is not a big surprise, since this is a very common issue with citrus fragrances and this is why I haven't taken a lippie off. After about 6 hours, the scent will fade. However, if you want to add a little extra something and a slightly gourmand note to Bergamotto di Calabria, here's an advice: apply Mandorlo di Sicilia first, which is also a perfume from the Acqua di Parma Blu Mediterraneo line and layer the Bergamotto di Calabria on top and you will notice that these two scents are a perfect match, almost like they have been made for eachother and it's a perfect fusion. The Mandorlo will give your Bergamotto a hint of almond and vanilla, making it a little warmer and softer without killing the signature bergamot scent, because Mandorlo itself contains bergamot and orange blossom as top notes. I purcased both for my bf and he loves wearing them on their own or together.	positif

652	23969457	This is one of my favourite everyday perfumes to wear. I discovered it when I was working in a beauty salon and one of the girls that I was working with walked past me and there was this gorgeous fresh scent lingering wherever she had been. It’s the perfect soft, powdery fragrance, with base notes of sandalwood, cashmere and ambergris, a heart of salted vanilla (which is the strongest part in my opinion) and top notes of mandarin, ginger and jasmine. It can be sickly sweet if too much is sprayed, and they released Olympéa Intense which I also tried - the smell is the same scent but stronger, and it lasts longer, and the packaging is the same as the original but is more of a bronze colour as opposed to the rose gold of the original, but I found the Intense version too sweet and strong. I prefer perfume to be subtle but noticeable rather than to announce itself as soon as you walk into a room, and I spray perfume behind my ears into my hair so when I’m outside and the wind picks up my hair people catch the scent I am wearing. Also, when I worked at John Lewis, me and the girls from Dior did a ‘natural scent test’ with the J’adore Touche De Parfum - this involved rubbing the Touche oil on our wrists and spraying J’adore on the oil. This would either smell like jasmine, vanilla or a third scent that I can’t remember and this would be your body’s natural scent and would indicate which perfumes suit you best - mine being jasmine so I am better suited to perfumes with notes of jasmine such as this one and Thierry Mugler’s Alien (review to come). I highly recommend this lovely perfume and it is one I will keep buying!!	positif
653	6222347	I've been using C. K. Euphoria for 12 years and really needed snorer perfume. I wanted a warm, cozy everyday scent for fall and winter. Aften the first sniff, i fell in love! This scent sits close to the skin on me, but wears for over 12 hours with one spray. The fragrance reminds me of a warm hug mixed with baking goods with cinnemon, vanilla and apple. I know some of these note aren't even in the perfume, but to me is smell like this.. And I feel so loved and safe when I wears this. It's strange. I do think the smell develops nicely over time and is so Wellington done through out. It's a complex scent, like sweet with an edge. It reminds me of Vera Wang Princess in a way, but a bit darker. The packaging is just bad in my opinion. The bottle feels and looks cheap. It's pink, wich really do not suit the scent at all.. I would think yellow or purple.and the fact that It's called girl, is almost funny to me. I would never have used this when I thought of myself as a girl.. I'm now 29 and this is a from up scent, I tink. You would also imagine from the ad that this perfume is rich and sensual for going out clubbing, but It's not (on me anyway). The toilette fades rather quickly and the perfume is best to use in daytime. It's lovely, not sexy! Anyway: When all is said, It's the juice that counts. I don't desplay my bottles, so it doesn't matter, but I would never have picket this up by the ad alone, and not by the bottle either. The only reason I stumbled apon this was on a whim, when I wanted a new daytime scent, and sniffed everything at my small boutique. This was one of the last ones I smelled, and really liked it. I've bought this last week and have used is several times already. Will be posting an update later on!	positif
654	5616480	Let it be known that my love affair with roses de chloé wasn't a love at first sniff. I didn't really pay attention to this variant because I was really into the original chloé and the love story. Until recently spring time finally came and i was looking for a new fragrance that will remind me of the fresh spring scent every time I use it. I sprayed the roses de chloé on the paper strip and oh boy it smelled like a plain rose water. It didn't excite me so I totally forgot about it. The next time I went to Sephora I sprayed it on my wrist. I dunno why I but it was totally different on the skin vs. the paper strip. On my skin it smelled like the most beautiful enchanting and freshest rose scent ever! It smelled so delicate and so feminine. The scent will transport you to a garden of roses in a clear crisp spring morning while touching the morning dew. It just blew me away. I didn't buy it right away because i wanted to test the silage and how it smells after a few hours. This scent didn't last the whole day fyi because the scent is really soft and mild. However I cannot forget this perfume that I went ahead and bought it anyway. Plus, most long lasting perfumes are those that are musky and strong, and the head ache trigger scents which I avoid especially in the spring and summer months. So I don't really mind if it doesn't last on me the whole day because I get to do a couple more spritz every time. I got the spray bottle and rollerball for touch ups during the day. And I am so happy I did. This perfume is the best perfume in my collection so far due to the fact that it puts me in a happy mood every time I use it. That's when you know you found your all time signature scent!!! Please don't ever discontinue this Chloé!	positif

664	464190	Draws Compliments,Great Smell,Long-Lasting,Sensual,Sexy I originally received a sample of this perfume. Long story short I fell in love. I ventured off to other fragrances in the last year but I went right back to Si. I've invested in the large bottle. This is not a flowery, ultra girly scent. It's sexy and musky. It's arousing. It last a long time. Shower and spray this on you will undoubtedly smell amazing the entire day. I even wear the scent to bed so I can smell it all night. When men smell this on me they are kind of taken aback bc of the change from flower smelling perfume most women wear. I once had a man say now THAT smells good. lol. I will be wearing Si forever.	positif
665	1036272	I’ve had a full size as well as a few travel sizes of this product, so it’s safe to say I’ve put it to the test. I am a dry shampoo junkie and have used various branded. This is so far my absolute favorite! It makes my hair feel clean, voluminous, and smells so fresh. It eliminates my oily roots and helps me to not have to wash my dry hair so frequently. The smell is the same as the signature LP scent they use in their products. I love that scent because it’s clean rather than “fragranced” so it doesn’t compete with my perfume. Some dry shampoos weigh down my hair but never this one. I am reviewing this as part of a contest for Influenster but these are my genuine thoughts.	positif
666	5395973	"This has become my ""school fragrance"", a perfume I wear when I go to school, because it stays close to the skin. It has somehow grew on me, I like the sweet scent, the vanilla, patchouli and cedar, topped with jasmine are really a nice blend and the pear and orange blossom give it a little ""lift"". It's not a unique scent, but very likeable, warm, sweet and feminine and goes well with my body chemistry. However, I can't seem to smell the coffee in this one, even though it's stated that it's one of the dominating scents in this fragrance. It is not my signature fragrance, which is Serge Lutens ""un bois vanille"", but it's good to switch now and then. So it's a 4.5 lippies from me =)"	positif
667	7839272	This is one of my more recent fragrance purchases, and definitely a splurge buy but I can honestly say it has already made it into my all time favorites. I have been reaching for this everyday, I think it wears best as a night time perfume, but I find myself wanting to wear it in the day time as well. Its such a warm, sultry scent. I definitely do notice the notes of coffee and vanilla, and the lasting power is incredible with this, one or two spritzes and I'm smelling it throughout the whole day (and I mean 12+ hours). I have the Black Opium scent in the dry oil as well so I will never run out or be without it!	positif
668	19059383	One of my favourite perfumes. The scent is just mind blowing and as they say, everyone has a different scent to add to a perfume. Well it doesn't matter how hot your body temperature gets, this beautiful fragrance just smells amazing on any skin type. I have chronic Urticuria, which is a autoimmune disorder of the skin, so, you would think such a rich perfume would irritate my skin, right? Wrong! I even spray my pillows before I go to bed with the perfume I have worn that day, and I have no irritation at all from this perfume. I don't worry about the cost, as a great perfume will last you a long time unless you bathe in it. It's worth every penny.	positif
669	19057488	If you love the smell of coffee in the morning and the sweetness of vanilla, you’ll love this fragrance. The first time I got to test this I was immediately in love. It worked so well with my personal body chemistry (aka ph balance). You can find this fragrance at Ulta, Sephora, & online too (i.e. YSLbeautyus.com) [it is not a cruelty free product, product is sold in China where animal testing is enforced.] There are so many amazing perfumes, but if you aren’t into the overly florally scents, like me, you will really love this scent. Truly is a beautiful scent!	positif
670	15221528	I used to wear this fragrance all the time - for work, date night, and during any season. I loved it so much. It was my signature scent for about a year. The florals are well balance, scent is sweet and long lasting. Pleasant smell that won't offend. This perfume is definitely getting s five star rating. However, it's everywhere now. Everyone has worn it. Everyone recognizes it. And I've smelt it over sprayed too many times now. I find I just don't reach for it anymore. I'm glad it's in my collection, and I still love the smell, but there are other fragrances I reach for more.	positif
671	7824584	"I just purchased a travel size version of Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb fragrance at Sephora because I wasn't sure I wanted to invest in one of the larger bottles. I'm so, so glad I did! For $35 it was a steal. This seems to be a cult favorite perfume, especially among beauty Youtubers. I'd describe the scent as ""sophisticated cotton candy"". It's flirty and feminine with strong floral notes but it's not overbearing. My boyfriend actually loves this scent on me and he's the one who suggested I purchase it -- which tells me that it's attractive and alluring. I like to smell good for my own sake, but it doesn't hurt if he appreciates it too. :)"	positif
672	7824753	This is one of my favorite fragrances. I normally do not like sweet smelling fragrances, but this one is unique. Just for reference, I prefer more musky scents like Elizabeth & James Black Nirvana and Burberry (big round classic bottle one). This isn't too sickly sweet and I find the scent quite girlie and feminine.This perfume has great lasting power and you only need a few pumps for a day. Many other scents fade quickly so this is important for me. It also has a very distinct scent and I can tell when someone is wearing it.Also, the packaging is beautiful. It is on the more expensive side, but well worth it.	positif
673	20229152	I love this scent so much. I was obsessed with it for two years before a bit the bullet and purchased it. It is a very pricey perfume for an Eau De Toilette. That said, this scent is completely unique and so worth it. It's slightly sweet, but not nearly to extent of the original flowerbomb. Mostly it is very fresh and rosy, but in the best way. Sometimes fragrances with rose in them just go terribly wrong, this one is perfect. Also, even though it's an eau de toilette, I can still smell it faintly on myself 8 hours into wear.	positif
674	14301382	It takes a real amazing scent for me to fall in love with a perfume and Viktor & Rolf have done it with this Flowerbomb fragrance. Just one spritz at Sephora was all I needed to be convinced that this was the perfume I've been looking for. It has a familiar floral fragrance that will be sure to pique nostalgic memories of the most beautiful scent you have ever smelled. You might as well throw all your perfume away now and go buy this one. My husband always compliments how nice it smells. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the Viktor & Rolf line is worth it's weight in gold. You can't put a price tag on confidence and with this fragrance you are sure to exert beauty and confidence all day long.	positif
675	16768588	Okay, so I'm a girl but I love woodsy, spicy scents. Kat von D's Sinner perfume is one of my go-to fragrances. I got a sample of Spicebomb in the mail, and although it's a little pricier than what I would usually like to spend on perfume, I think I'm going to get some. It's not an overly musky fragrance - instead, you get more notes of cedar, clove, and other spices that blend beautifully and smell enticing and warm together. Better yet, it is incredibly long lasting and strong. A small amount will do the trick and I noticed the lingering scent all day. Definitely worth the price. If you are in the market for a new fall scent this might just be the thing.	positif
676	4831569	I meant originality for the uniqueness of this scent. I have never scented any fragrance like this before. Longevity of the fragrance moderate as of a EDT or body mist. I would not categorize this under perfume due to the staying power. The first spray I can pick up a very strong Tonka bean - vanilla ish and when it settle is more subdue and softer scent. But not powdery - it is a mixture of chocolate - Rum- Vanilla and caramel in my opinion. I can picture myself walk in to an Old-Fashion Ice Cream Parlor where you can smell- Chocolate Sundae-	positif
677	5396474	This was a blind purchase, which I know can be bad when buying perfume, but I love the mystery I guess. I am glad purchased this, I saved about $25 bucks at Fragrance X online. I like how soft and feminine this stuff smells, it has a nice sweet candied flower smell, slightly powdery reminds me more of violets than roses, I can smell hints of vanilla and a warming soft musk. I wouldn't consider this a fruity perfume which I thought it was, there is raspberry note but I feel it is more syrupy than juicy/crisp. Overall I like this perfume alot, it is not a trendy or creative scent but more of a old-fashioned corset-wearing, glamorous flower scent, it is sexy and mysterious with good strength and lasting power.	positif
678	18215668	Wow I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this scent, in fact I love it! It’s citrusy and floral in the beginning but quickly turned sweet and gourmand on my skin. I know iris is suppose to be the heart of the fragrance, a lot of people don’t know what iris smells like. I had iris flowers in my backyard growing up in Nebraska. I can smell the iris more so in the shimmery body lotion than the eau de Parfum. The perfume is more sweet. I don’t know why it took me so long to smell this perfume but I’m glad I did! I can see this becoming my signature scent.	positif
679	5406213	I got this perfume as a gift and i can say i love the smell. It's gorgeous, but the downside is the bottle it's self...it's very small and i don't feel that you are getting your moneys worth of product for the price you pay for it which is a shame. Having said that, When sprayed lightly it's quite a subtle but noticeable scent but with a sweet, but very sophisticated fragrance. This perfume is perfect for that special occasion or event when the scent isn't going to overpower people when you walk into a room. As for how long the perfume should last...i guess that depends on how much you choose to spray.	positif
680	23065967	To start, I have never really cared much about high end perfumes. I've always been content with my bath and body works scents & victoria secrets. I never understood why people would spend so much on a fragrance... and then I experienced Miss Dior's absolutely blooming. I tried a sample and fell in love with the smell and how long it lasted on my skin. Not too long after I went through that sample I got one more, lasted me a month. My boyfriend loved the smell so much on me, he gifted it to me for christmas. Seriously the best scent ever. It has musk tones, and sweet tones. Its perfect for someone who likes a very subtle scent. My first high end fragrance, and probably my only. Thank you Dior!	positif
681	11786868	"I am new to this brand of perfume, ""J'adore"" was a gift. I love its sensual yet elegant and feminine whiff of brilliant notes of orchids, velvety and silky Damascus plum and alluring blackberry musk. I spray it on my wrists, behind my ears and at the back of my knees as well for a long-lasting effect. Even after a night's shower or bath, I could still smell it on me. It's so fragrantly scent-tillating!It leaves a scent of you behind with this very elegant and sophisticated floral fragrance by Christian Dior.I wholeheartedly recommended."	positif
682	15425997	Love it! Here's the notes on the scent : Christian Dior Poison Girl Women's Eau de Parfum Spray It opens with top notes of bitter orange that blend delicately with heart center notes of damask and grasse rose. The base notes are delightfully swathed in vanilla, sandalwood, venezuelan tonka bean, tofu balm and almond. This new, bitter-sweet floral fragrance with a mouthwatering orange twist is a scandalously pleasing choice for the rebellious young woman. I love the smell of this perfume. I constantly get comments on how good I smell and often get asked which scent I'm wearing. Also I think the price is good I don't think it's expensive. I treat myself to this perfume monthly	positif
683	10535309	"- The perfume. A super gooey, heavy and solid, long and deep aroma. It's not a scent that ""you smell quickly"" but intoxicates, and tend to like everyone. I empathize with the elegance automatically.- The packaging is beautiful and luxurious as could be.- The aroma is the most enduring I've ever smelled. I prefer the scent format by its intensity and because you wake up the next day still smelling.- Do not lose intensity over hours.- I believe that every woman, young and classic, falls in love with this fragrance. No age, yes elegance !!"	positif
684	1341302	In my teenage years up to my 30's, I suffered from migraine headaches. Strong perfumes (most fragrances) would trigger a headache immediately- I only needed someone to walk pass me and I'd be incapacitated for 24hrs. I stopped wearing any fragrances until a lady at the Clarins counter suggested this fragrance. I have never looked back. It is refreshing, youthful, classy and demure in its scent..subtle but distinctly punchy with its essential oils. You know when someone walks past you that they are wearing Eau Dynamisante because it has the most unique smell. I also love the fact that friends always comment at how lovely I smell and ask for another hug! Advantages: women, refreshing vibrant scent	positif
685	5150506	I literally just unboxed this perfume and sprayed it on my wrist to test it and...WOW. It left me speechless. I can't stop smelling it. I walked into the room my fiancé was in and immediately he goes God..whatever you have on..please keep wearing it! The best way I can describe this is just..classy. Very unique fresh feminine scent. Chanel perfumes are some of the absolute best, which is why I typically purchase them without testing them first. I've never been disappointed and this fragrance DEFINITELY doesn't disappoint. I can see this becoming my signature scent.	positif
686	24642876	long lasting phenomenal scent. Wow! This is my first Chanel fragrance and I'm so impressed. It smells very fresh, kind of aquatic and a touch of green and citrus. It's a happy kind of scent. Perfect for daytime/office/spring/summer. It also lasts ALL DAY. I've never had a perfume last this long on me. It will stick to me until I shower, and even then I swear I can still smell it on my wrists. I get compliments even at the end of the day when I don't think I can noticeably smell it anymore. I just can't get over this perfume!!	positif
687	7818359	Love this scent. I have been buying this scent from Chanel for some time now and it is one of the best smelling fragrance I own. I have tried other scents but could not get the same fragrance from any other. This is one of my daily perfume and I get so many compliments when I wear it. It is long last lasting and fresh. I put it on in the morning and by the end of the day, it still smells very good. It's worth the money, it lasts me a little less than a year and I use it almost every day.	positif
688	24352862	This is my fragrance! For anyone who knows me, they say this smell reminds them of me because I have been wearing it for years! I will always have Chanel Chance. Always! I cannot express my love for this wonderful scent. It's what sexy happiness smells like. The body satin came with a gift someone bought for me. I had never even heard of this product before but I love creams and this had my signature scent on it so it's like a double whammy love! It's perfect for when I forget to wear perfume (rushing out, you forget this part of your beauty routine) and you feel okay because you remember you put on some body cream! So phew, you won't smell like a default shower soap.	positif
689	10543907	I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this perfume I received in my most recent VoxBox. I am not usually a heavy perfume wearer, and most of my scents are super light, citrus heavy, or clean. This scent was completely different from all of those, yet still wasn't too heavy on the florals and musks that I don't love about most designer fragrances for ladies. I think the best part was the soft vanilla scent that smoothed out all of the other notes. The only downside to this is that my husband remarked that I smelled just like my mom the first time I wore it. He's super sensitive to smells, so it is always a weird thing when he connects something like that. Haha.	positif

691	5607269	perfect vanilla. This is the best smelling vanilla fragrance ever - not too sweet like the ones that smell like cake batter. This vanilla is perfect, with a touch of citrus that's very subtle and doesn't confuse the vanilla. The problem is that it is so weak! Unlike many of the other viewers, I have to spray mine every two hours or you can't smell it which is frustrating since I hardly sweat at all. For this price I would expect the scent to linger longer. This fragrance is more characteristic of a weak cologne than a perfume. I took a star off for the price and underperformance. Eventhough I love this scent I probably won't buy again.	positif
692	19717264	HUMAN CATNIP. This fragrance is like human catnip...I smell it on myself or anyone and immediately I am overcome with an indescribable attraction to the scent. It’s absolutely intoxicating. The bergamot pops immediately and then mellows out to the rest of the warmer, woodsy notes. Because it’s a pure perfume you only need one spritz on the neck/chest and one on the inner arm, and the scent blooms and radiates for hours on end. You’ll smell the sandalwood linger on your sweaters days later. It’s soft, sensual, and rich—and while the price is a bit painful, it’s worth it.	positif
693	24636782	So juicy and natural! I LOVE this perfume, every moment of it. From the sharp, herbal scent at the beginning, to the pure, real scent of oranges that it dries down to. It is GORGEOUS. Not too femme, which is good, as most of my other fragrances are. This is just an all around refreshing and beautiful perfume. My sister says it smells too much like cologne, but I love that clean, natural, herbal smell. I bought the Discovery Set from Atelier directly and this was hands down my favourite. This one and Trefle Pur. Only thing I'd change is the longevity, though I can still smell fresh, juicy oranges hours after spraying!	positif
694	15538556	This is such a beautiful fragrance. The scent of fig and woodsy floral greens. I spritz this on just before I go out, and I can still smell it 7 hours later. Not an over powering scent but a feminine softness instead. Good for going out in the day or at night. A nice summer fragrance that I don't need a lot of and lasts all day. The packaging looks gorgeous, classy, clean and feminine. Something that looks pretty and expensive on your counter. I will be checking other scents by Roger & Gallet. I also feel like for the amount of perfume you get and how long it lasts it is a steal compared to bottles that cost over $100 and last and hour. This was given to me free by Glam Sense for my honest opinion.	positif
695	17749473	"Slightly musky (it must be the vanilla undertones) but lightened a bit by the jasmine and blackcurrant... it's definitely a recognisable scent. One of the fragrances that I can apply to my skin and still have it smell the same as it does in the bottle. This is good stuff. I'm on my second (or maybe it's my third) bottle now. It's delicious. Also, I always get lots of questions or comments when I wear it; ""What perfume are you wearing?"" ""Is that Amor Amor?"" ""You smell great!"" I'd use something lighter for every day, but I'd definitely say this is a date night scent ;)"	positif
696	1568586	Beautifully sweet yet rich scent that smells great for hours and hours. It's quite a strong fragrance so I'd recommend it more as a evening scent that a day one. But it can work as either depending on your own style and preference.It comes in really nice packaging and the bottle is bold yet feminine covered in a layer of sparkling glitter. The only down point for me is the cost per ml ratio. But I guess this is to be expected when purchasing something with a high end brand attached. That being said I would definitely save up in order to buy this one over other perfumes as its gorgeous and I receive so many compliments when wearing it.	positif
697	6160914	"This is a lightweight conditioner that detangles, and softens hair, and helps to keep frizz at bay. It is excellent for co-washing. It smells a little funky in the 33.8 oz bottle (strangely, it smells fine in the 13.8 oz oz bottles), but it leaves a cheerful, cherry-lemonade scent in hair. The fragrance is light, and non-irritating. So many companies have highly perfumed products that smells like 1980s mens cologne (CHI's Infra, Redken Conditioner Cleansers) or 80s women's perfume (BTZ, ApHogee, Moroccanoil, Alterna, Philip P), that I can't stand to use them. My husband likes the ""girly"" scent in my hair. (His term, not mine.)"	positif
698	18250379	I received this perfume (and cologne) complimentary in a voxbox and I was SO happy and excited! I really like a lot of Armani fragrances, and these ones are no different. I definitely preferred the men’s scent over the women’s, but both were long lasting and strong which I like. The packaging is super cute too, the only issue is the cap. It has to be lined up perfectly or you end up spraying some product into the cap. The women’s fragrance “because it’s you” is a super feminine scent. It’s very floral and musky and smells just, expensive. I highly recommend both fragrances!!	positif
699	18249397	SEXY- MYSTERIOUS SCENTThis perfume smells amazing !!!. As soon as I opened the box I found a heavy glass bottle with a clean/ modern design that speaks quality.The first time he sprayed it on we both were absolutely amazed by the light sweetness yet spicy fragrance. It has a very elegant, masculine yet sensual scent for men.It is a very long-lasting perfume whenever he sprays it on him he leaves the room with the scent for minutes...My husband uses it all the time day and night. He gets lots of compliments. I received this free product thanks to Influenster and Emporio Armani beauty to give my honest review.	positif
700	25826356	I found this scent more thn 10 years ago and its the only perfume I've returned to time and time again since. Lovely, classy, timeless and refreshing at the same time. It's a fragrance that i got the most compliments wearing. It is so enticing and makes me feel sexy when I wear it on a night out.  I like its uniqueness in not being too traditionally feminine/girly - not too floral nor too sweet.  It has a very distinctive smell and it lasts a long time on my skin. I do personally think it is more of an occasion/night-time scent. I highly recommend for those who like heavier fragrances.	positif
701	23691142	I just bought the 50ml bottle because I needed a new perfume and this was on offer. The lady behind the perfume counter in boots helped me pick it out. I really like the bottle! The scent is quite grown up for me I usually like very sweet and strong scents (prada candy and Marc Jacobs decadence in my current rotation) Fragrance family: Fruity FloralTop Notes: Lychee & RaspberryHeart Notes: Bulgarian Rose Absolute, Lily of the Valley & FreesiaBase Notes: Amber, Vetiver & VanillaI would definitely recommend this perfume to others. I get lots of compliments about smelling nice and often get asked which scent it is when I wear it.	positif
702	4917695	I agree with most reviewers that the scent is amazing. it is beachy with a sweet scent. I think because I love going to the beach and this fragrance reminds me of that, I love it. But the quality isn't that good, like it says on the bottle, it is a spay, not a perfume. It goes away completely after 3-4 hours for me. Also it does smell a little differently on the skin than on paper. So I would expect to smell differently on different people as well. I might have to carry it with me for reapplies.	positif
703	5071276	breathtaking, fresh. This fragrance is an escape from every day life each time I smell it. It has a very light and bright scent that's fruity/citrusy. I'm a complete sucker for perfume's with Jasmine, which this fragrance has. I love this scent for the fact that it whisks me away to a breezy, warm day even in the cold Colorado weather. Well worth the price, and the spray nozzle is great quality that disperses the perfect amount with each spritz. The most impressive part about the Maison Martin Margiela fragrances, is that they smell EXACTLY as they are named/described. Such a great brand!	positif
704	19672724	I may just have to buy this... This fragrance is pure perfection! I rarely try perfume samples, but the name of this one stood out to me, & from the first spritz I was hooked. I love to just dab it on my wrists so I can smell them whenever I’m feeling stressed. They somehow managed to capture all the best smells of a dressing table, and created a scent that’s powerful, sexy and a little bit dangerous. I think I may have to take the plunge & buy the bottle of this. It’s just so intoxicating & makes me feel unstoppably fabulous. For reference, my typical scent go-to’s are Coco Mademoiselle, Atelier Cologne’s Orange Sanguine, & Tokyo Milk’s Tainted Love.	positif
705	23330541	Uniquely Sexy I wasn’t expecting to like this as much as I did! At first spritz, I briefly thought, “Oh, another powdery sweet perfume.” Throughout the day, though, I found myself really enjoying any whiff I got of it— I could smell it easily, but the sillage was still subtle enough for my office. It really does smell like a bit of lipstick as well as powder, vanilla, and my chemistry develops a bit of spice too. It is a sexy scent in a very unique way. I’m trying out a bunch of fragrances to find my signature scent, and so far this is the frontrunner.	positif
706	5101016	Received this in my play box. Normally I dislike receiving perfume samples but the Replica scents are the exception! I tried this on and found it interesting- it really does smell like a fire. After a while the scent shifted into a smoky, spicy scent that vaguely reminded me of E & J's Nirvana, which I only wear in fall/winter. It's long wearing too; when I woke up this morning I caught a whiff of it still on my wrist, and it made me smile. So I guess this will be my next fragrance purchase, whenever I can save up the money! A rollerball option would be great for those of us on a budget!	positif
707	5925637	I LOVE this perfume! It's perfectly beachy- smells like sunshine, surf, and citrus with a little coconut and maybe a bit of sunscreen. I love Bobbi Brown's Beach perfume too but that one smells mostly of Coppertone and really doesn't last. The reviews that state that this one doesn't last long may be nose-blind to the subtle scent. I generally do not wear perfumes- just scented lotions and this one lasts all day on me. It is subtle and designed to be a scent where you need to be close to smell it- you're not going to walk in a cloud of fragrance with this one. If you douse yourself in perfume- this is not for you.	positif
708	15298308	I love this scent, I find that floral and citrus scents can end up smelling quite sickly and girlish, but this one manages to smell really sophisticated despite being a sweet scent. It has a gorgeous sweetness to it with the neroli, but the vanilla stops it being too sweet by bringing in a more musky undertone. It's also strong enough that you can smell it throughout the day which is something I always want in a perfume! The bottle is lovely and it sprays a generous amount each time. I'm really in love with this fragrance and apparently am not the only one - I've had so many compliments when wearing it!	positif
709	4772903	good value, exotic, different, sweet, spicy, coconut, vacation like. I am absolutely in love with this fragrance. I have been wearing it for 4 years now. Every single day I get compliments on it. I love the coconut notes of it. It is sensual and exotic and sweet smelling. I have other perfumes that I wear but nothing ever seems to compare to the impact of this one. Its truly worth the money and lasts a long time because you don't need to spray yourself that much with the perfume. The scent will last all day! I have even had people tell me they smell me everywhere because it leaves the scent behind. Like I said, always have been getting nothing but amazing comments.	positif
710	7841538	I have 4 Versace perfumes and this is my springtime scent. It's delicate and fresh. One of my favorites to wear to work because it lasts all day but not loud and overbearing. I hate being the person with annoyingly strong perfume. I want people to smell me when I pass by and they catch a nice note of fragrance. I'm at the very last of my third bottle. This is probably the only Versace perfume that doesn't give me a headache or have me sneezing by the end of the day. I love this scent so much I've barred my sisters from ever buying. it. I don't want anyone smelling like me. This is definitely in my top 5 of perfumes.	positif
711	11069997	First of all if you have a Pink (Bright Crystal ) Perfume you might not need this one cause the scent is very similar. Overall it smells fresh, summery, citrusy and i do receive a lot of compliments that i smell good when i wear it. Easily could be an every day fragrance, i get tired of same fragrance wearing too often and too much but not this one. Keep in mind this is not a Perfume or eau de perfume, it is Eau De Toilette, what makes it smell light and fresh, but at the same time the scent wont last long so you do have to reapply before the moments you want to be noticed	positif
712	17297638	I absolutely love this fragrance.. it has such a fresh smell perfect for summer and spring... although i do wear it all year round just because its such a soft flowy perfume. My one and only thing is that i do wish the smell would last on my skin a bit longer. I get about 4 hours or so wear time before its almost totally faded. I will say that if it somehow get sprayed on some clothing that scent lasts for ages! If you looking for a fresh gentle fruity/floral smell without either of those being to over powering then this is def a scent worth testing out.	positif
713	19335882	SUCH A FEMININE & PRETTY FRAGRANCE. LOVE THE VIOLET SCENT, WHICH SETTLES TO A CREAMY, SEDUCTIVE SWEET-FLORAL PERFUME. TO BE HONEST, I HADN’T HEARD OF LOLITA LEMPICKA BEFORE, UNTIL I WAS GIFTED A BOTTLE OF ONE OF HER OTHER EDP’s. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. AND THIS PERFUME IS EQUALLY AS LOVELY. I LIKE THE FACT THAT NOT EVERYONE AND THEIR AUNTIE IS WEARING THIS SCENT...AND THAT IT ATTRACTS COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHERS, EVEN STRANGERS ON THE STREET HAVE ASKED ME WHAT I’M WEARING, AND SAID HOW NICE I SMELL. I GUESS THAT SAYS IT ALL. THE BOTTLE DESIGN IS VERY PRETTY TOO, & LOOKS GREAT ON MY DRESSING TABLE.	positif
714	10919376	Transforming Cream SPF 30 has fragrance, so I recommend you to do a patch test before making a purchase if you have a fragrance sensitivity. Other than that, it smells just like how you would expect from La Prairie; not too perfumey, aromatic or floral. My nose is exceptionally sensitive to the scent that I can't actually use some of natural skincare products as they give me a headache and nausea. However, I've been doing great with the Transforming Cream SPF 30, which is indeed a good news as the scent doesn't last long either :).	positif
715	18841687	I am happy I was chosen to test this fragrance for free. I am extremely happy with it. I find that it lasts all day and have had many people compliment me on the sweet fragrance. One scent that I find it gives off more on me is the smell of honeysuckle which is absolutely breath taking. I sprayed some on my mom and on her the caramel scent stands out. Everybody is going to be different because of our body chemistry. I love it on myself and with my mom it's a little different but smells great on her. I totally recommend it for wearing every day whether your at an office or in a restaurant it's not going to be to strong but it will last. If you don't wear perfume to often I would also wear it out to a dinner or lounge.	positif
716	17840105	I love this perfume, it isn't the only Jimmy Choo fragrance I own but it is definitely my favorite and when I run out (if ever) I will have to repurchase. This fragrance is so light but long lasting, like REALLY long lasting, I only spray once and I smell it throughout the whole day, I definitely like this kind of scent more in the spring months since the largest portion of it is very floral, but you do smell a little bit of spice in there and overall it's just really a clean daytime scent. The packaging is also very pretty and nice to display.	positif
717	19010553	Oh my god! This smells amazing. I randomly decided a week or two ago that I wanted to start wearing perfume. From that point, I went on YouTube and watched a bunch of reviews on top women’s fragrances. I had to listen to other people describe them to the best of their ability. I ended up choosing Gucci Bamboo and I am so pleased with it! It’s a nice floral, light and slightly sweet scent. It smells amazing! I would definitely recommend it. It lasts for a long time which is also a bonus. I sprayed my coat with it a week ago and the scent is still lingering.	positif
718	24637565	Smells amazing and great gift I got this scent as a sample and fell in love. It is my new favorite scent. I reach for it so much! Initially the perfume was coming out of the bottle as a squirt and not a mist spray, but now it's a mist. Not sure what that was about. Also be sure to screw the top on tight for the rollerball. I did not and all the fragrance leaked out so I had to purchase a new one unfortunately ;(, but my purse belongings smelt amazing lol =) would make a wonderful gift. Dont hesitate to buy!	positif
719	23017635	I thinking this Bottle is well designed I also think the packaging is very eye Catching. I do like the fragrance of this perfume I would say more a daytime perfume. I sampled product on friends and family all agreeing the scent has a very distinctive floral sweet smell all saying they would wear it. My work colleagues all complimented on the smell. I love the fact The scent is not strong and feel it lasted all day. I will certainly look forward to using this daily without the need for a top up. Very happy indeed with product!!

720	5395384	"I am a ""perfume addict,"" as my mom calls me; my favorite fragrances include the following: Ralph Lauren Romance, Chanel No 5 Eau PremiÃ©re, Burberry London, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Calvin Klein Beauty, and Dior Hypnotic Poison. I had some leftover Christmas money and was in a department store, I thought, ""hey why not buy new perfume!"" I was torn between Chanel's Coco Noir and Dolce & Gabbana's The One. After finally deciding, I chose The One (no pun intended lol). It's amazing! It has an amber-y vanilla scent to it. And while I'm not a huge fan of very sweet fragrances, The One is an exception, as it has more of a sexy and warm smell. It's a very warm and seductive scent."	positif
721	19870973	"If you're expecting this to smell like Aqua di Gio or Cool Water, or some of the other ""blue"" fragrances, you will be disappointed. This was at a reasonable price, but the scent really smelled sub-par, like a drugstore cologne. My husband said it smelled too ""perfumy"" (He has a pretty discerning taste in colognes...likes Aqua di Gio, Drakkar, CK colognes, etc.) but did NOT like this one. Daughter said it smelled like ""girl's perfume"", and he agreed. Personally, I think it smells like men's cologne when it is first applied, but it lightens too quickly to a somewhat feminine scent. I would NOT recommend this product."	positif
722	15673517	I love perfumes I have a big collection and a huge variety as well.. I have to say this one is by far one of the best fragrances I own.. I love the bottle I mean comeon its a stiletto super cute specially cuz I love heels.. The scent actually lasts on you which is amazing because most scents ware off fast on me not this one I could still smell it on me by lunch time.. I very gotten very good compliments as well.. It is pricy but so very worth it the quality and scent are exceptional definitely recommend you buy it or even try it at sephora ask for a sample to take home and I guarantee you will come and purchase the full size product..	positif
723	20071403	Top Notes: mandarin orange, grapefruit, bergamotMiddle Note: freesia, jasmine, rose. Base Note: MuskThis fragrance is the scent of innocence. It is light and sweet and reminds me of being young again. The citrus scents come out loud and clear, but the floral notes come to the forefront very quickly. I really like this light scent, which would be perfect for the spring/summertime. Amazing Grace would especially be good for a young girl just starting out with perfume. The only drawback. It doesn't last very long. At the most you can smell the base note up to three hours later, but not much longer. philosophy 'amazing grace' spray fragrance	positif
724	25907471	Every year I get the new Summer fragrance that Philosophy comes out with and usually they have around the same notes...really beachy with some coconut and a floral sent. However, endless summer surprised me. This year the scent is very sweet and it really reminds me of Jo Malone’s Nectarine Blossom and Honey, especially the lotion! And I love it!! There is a sweet citrus smell and it’s not so beachy..but that’s ok! The lotion is great and I use it on my freshly shaved legs. The perfume doesn’t last as long as the other two, probably because of the different scent. Overall, this is a great set I’m very pleased this year! philosophy Pure Grace Endless Summer 2pc Set	positif
725	6183597	I received the Kat Von D Saint and Sinner fragrance complimentary from Influenster to review and put to the test. Sinner is a floral fruity scent with a hint of spice. The scent is definitely more stronger and you could still smell a hint of it the next day. Saint is more sweeter; I love the fresh & feminine hints of floral and vanilla in Saint. This perfume was light which makes it the perfect day time wear. I must say design in the full size is gorgeous. I highly recommend anyone to try and its a must have perfume on your beautiful vanity! @katvondbeauty@influenster. saintandsinner. complimentary. contest. theresurreactionisreal	positif
726	6219135	I'm extremely sensitive to fragrance. So usually its hard for me to wear perfume without it giving me a headache. I received sample versions of Saint and Sinner in my Sephora Play Box and by far my favorite is Sinner. It smells really good while still being a gentle scent that doesn't give me a migraine. If you like stronger scents, you probably won't like Sinner and Saint might be more up your alley. Also a completely random side note, my fiancee absolutely loves this smell of Sinner. Because it has notes of Orange Blossom in it, it somehow reminds him of a really delicious IPA. lol So its a scent we can both enjoy. lol	positif
727	6219277	I received this perfume complementary for review from Influenster. Being a huge fan of Katvond beauty as is I was thrilled to be able to try these. Kvd does all of her artwork and she didnt miss the mark on her perfumes because the packaging is stunning. The fragrance itself made me feel like I transformed when I put it on. From very basic to sexy and chic. It has more of a muskier scent than Saint and smells just a touch more masculine. Not in a manly way but a sophisticated, elegant, confident woman way. The scent last forever and seemed to get sweeter throughout the day. I will for sure be purchasing in the very near future.	positif
728	10551037	"I received the Kat Von D ""Sinner"" and ""Saint"" perfumes from Influenster for testing purposes. At first sniff, I was drawn towards the ""Sinner"" fragrance -- it's a has a sultry allure, something I would wear on a date night with my hubby. The scent lasts quite long and is a little more on the muskier side, whereas its counterpart fragrance ""Saint"" was more sweet and floral smelling, more girly. The two scents have similar floral notes so when blended together, it becomes an incredible scent. The scents are quite pleasant and a little goes a long way. The bottles are very pretty as well. "	positif
729	18880850	This is such a unique scent, it's sweet fragrance. There's never been any other perfume that I know of that smells like Alien. It's been becoming popular lately although it's certainly been around for about 10 years. My mom bought me my first bottle at that time. Also, the scent seriously lasts all day and night. I still smell it on my clothes when I'm doing laundry. So let's say, I spray it on a shirt I'm wearing, I'll smell it a week later when doing laundry. It's more expensive than most designet perfumes but the quality is out of this world. Thierry Mugler creates wonderful fragrances!!!	positif
730	5069945	I am a practically a perfume collector. I'm seriously addicted to trying and buying new fragrances for my collection. I typically prefer to buy scents that my husband likes; but he is a tough critic, and has accused me of often buying perfumes with similar notes. I usually go for scents that have an underlying vanilla smell. I got this one as sample, and when I tried it, my husband told me that was his favorite one to date. It's more of a floral scent, and not one that I typically go for, and to honest, when I initially smelled it, I was not impressed, but this smell mixes well with my own natural body scent, and I bought the full size.	positif
731	5223361	I just got this as a Valentine's gift from my 3 year old daughter and my husband, and I think that they found me my signature scent!Butterfly really suits its name, it reminds me of what springtime smells like in the woods of Nova Scotia since many berries grow wild out there; this is a comforting scent for me as it reminds me of home. It's got this delicious sweetness to it without being a true gourmand, and while there's no vanilla listed I definitely pick up a sweet softness at the dry down of this fragrance; something like the dusty quality of a butterfly wing. This perfume is a lovely, unique but very wearable late 90's gem; I will always have a bottle now that I know how truly wonderful it is.	positif
732	5395757	Whenever I'm in or near myer for a few minutes/hours, and i have a few minutes of spare time, i love going and testing every perfume and finding my new favorites to buy. This one, (although i think the bottle could be a lot nicer considering how nice the persume is should be a bit more 'flash'. The bottle actually made me think it was a cheap perfume!), particularly appealed to me. It seemed every scent in myer was a typical smelling perfume that i couldn't see anything special about. But this one had a sexy vanilla scent that i preferred to all the other ralph lauren perfumes including the romance perfume itself. I am particularly fond of vanilla scents though, so that may be the reason i liked it so much. Either way, a keeper in my fragrance faves book!	positif
733	4801867	I received a deluxe sample of this product via influenster for my honest review. I absolutely love this fragrance! It's my now my everyday perfume! Once I finish my sample I'll definitely be purchasing the full size! It's a sexy seductive scent! I usually love something more warm and sweet but I've been wanting to try something new and I was so glad when I received it that I actually liked it, it is more on the floral side but a warmer sweet floral! My boyfriend loves the scent! He's very sensitive to perfume so when he pointed out that I smelled different and he loved it I was so relieved.	positif
734	4802254	good value. I am not a huge perfume person, mainly because I forget to wear it most of the time. I have this vanilla body spray that I like and I'll spray if I feel like I'm a little stinky but that's about it. I am a bit picky with fragrances I guess, that is kind of why I enjoy vanilla because it's simple and doesn't come off as too strong but still smells nice and clean. Though this scent I did enjoy very much. Tender Romance's scent smells sweet and soft at the same time. It's not too powerful but it'll still make you smell really lovely and make you feel pretty great.	positif
735	5064863	This fragrance is everything I've been looking for in a perfume or cologne. When I was a teenager I smoked clove cigarettes, mostly just because I loved the smell. After clove cigarettes were banned in many states they became very hard to find and I've really missed their Christmas-y scent. (The smell and taste of chai tea is quite similar, though the scent of tea doesn't linger on your skin and clothes.) This fragrance is like clove cigarettes and chai... I love it but it's definitely not for everyone. Personally, I don't find that it smells overly of Christmas or pipe tobacco, just enough to make me like it! I suggest sampling before purchasing, though.	positif
736	23323271	Beautifully unique scent from TF. On me it wears as a sharp powder at first spray, followed by an almost marzipan creaminess - with the subtle sage notes dancing throughout the hours. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever smelled, and the silage and wear are both great! It’s a very comforting scent, and I would recommend it more as an evening perfume- and it may be too heavy for summer, but it’s definitely worth a try for anyone who is curious. I typically wear gourmand fragrances- and I would sit this as a very unique fragrance with gourmand notes as well as soft herbal notes. If you hate powdery scents- skip this!	positif
737	15302021	This is without doubt the most beautiful and alluring perfume I've ever seen and that's before I've sprayed a single drop! The bottle is ornamental and deserves pride of place on any dressing table. One spritz of this perfume is enough to be enveloped in the feminine flavour of Eau So Decadent. It's sweet floral fragrance is the perfect day time aroma, add another spritz and you have easily gone from day to night with a perfume that will have people stopping you all night asking just what scent you are wearing. My husband said it was the most feminine scent he had had the pleasure to smell. Eau So Decadent is described perfectly in its name and has me feeling like it's summer all year round. Beautiful yet seductive, subtle yet alluring [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
738	5132502	My mother is a perfume snob and casually hinted that she wanted a new fragrance that wasn't so trendy and easily identifiable. I thought this scent was perfect because it appeals to those who love floral, earthy, grassy, woody fragrances but when it warms on the skin after a few hours there's a subtle garden spiciness lingering on your skin. I disagree that it doesn't last long. The smell isn't as strong as a parfum after a few hours but the scent does linger in softer, but still very pleasant, notes after awhile. I purchased it for my Mom but I'm going to buy myself a bottle and I rarely wear perfume. It makes me feel like such a fashionista lol.	positif
739	7831635	I tend to love the limited edition scents, especially the summer scents, but I promise that there is a scent for you! There are so many! My mom is very sensitive to perfume, so I never had any growing, but these fragrance mists are light enough that they don't bother her and stay on for a long time so people can still smell it, even though it's light. If you're not into perfumes but still want to have a nice, light scent, try them out! Not to mention the great sales and deals always going on!	positif
740	24339357	Im 20, I have been using this scent everyday since i was 10... possibly younger. it is a great everyday scent it smell subtle of flowers and makes me feel like I smell clean! I also have very sensitive skin to the point where i would get red spots wherever perfumes hit me, but not with this one, i absolutely love Bath Body Works Bath & Body Works Sweet Pea Fine Fragrance Mist 8 oz (New Look), the entire collection Bath Body Works Bath and Body Works Signature Collection Anti-bacterial Handibac Hand Spray Sweet PeaBath & Body Works Sweet Pea Body LotionBath & Body Works PocketBac Hand Gel Sweet Pea	positif
741	24322001	I was very skeptical when I first bought it due to the fact that I normally just buy their lotions and body washes, however, my best friend talked me into it. It can be used as an all over body lotion and since the amount is limited its great cuz you don't have to use that much to moisturize your skin. What i do because it has an amazing scent and to make it last a lot longer is use regular lotion and just add a small amount of the b&bw souffle to it for added moisture. Also when i just need to add a small hint of fragrance i use a little on my exogenous zones like my neck insude my elbows and wrist. Allows the scent to last without the alcohol or strong smell of perfume.	positif
742	5051926	I hardly ever take the time to write reviews on a product unless the product blows me away. Juliette Has A Gun is such a beautiful scent! It was honestly love at first spray. This scent isn't overbearing, but doesn't go unnoticed either. It has excellent staying power - the next day after wearing, I often still smell this perfume lingering on my skin. Truly a unique fragrance. I wore it out on a date and the guy I am seeing kept giving me compliments about how great smelled. I have never smelt anything like this fragrance before. My only regret is purchasing the 1.7oz and not the 3.3oz!	positif
743	5153975	Ok, at 18.00 this is a steal. There's no way you won't love at least half the scents in here. They are all incredible. All my favorite smells of Jasmine,musks, amber,roses,honeysuckle are all in here. Plus a few surprises. The addition of the not a perfume large size scent really makes this worth it. You can wear tgat stuff all on its own for a mysterious can't quite put your finger on it scent that NO ONE else is wearing. Plus if you layer it with the other fragrances they get transformed. It's so cool. This set is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to all you perfume junkies out there!	positif
744	4719912	sexy, sophisticated. Ugh I am obsessed with this scent. I tried it on in store, and immediately fell in love. I don't really have a fragrance type, and I also usually stick with 2 or 3 perfumes, but I will branch out for this one. It is an extremely sexy scent, and it makes me feel sophisticated and wonderful. I didn't even know what gardenia smelled like but apparently I love it! I got a sample of this from one of my online Sephora purchases, and it is on my Valentine's Day list for boyfriend to buy	positif
745	19665468	Marc Jacobs Decadence This fragrance was alright, not a favorite of mine personally because I do not personally like floral fragrances. I could totally see someone who likes a light floral scent. I personally think I would like the eau de parfum better, if it is a little more woody. But this eau de toillete is definitely a sheer light floral scent feminine smell. I gave it a good review because for the right person, it is long lasting and strong. You will definitely leave an impression with this eau de toillete. Also, the packaging is pretty amazing and super cute. The bag handle top really differentiates this with other perfume bottles and I wish I could love this more!	positif
746	18322311	This is my favorite and staple perfume of all time. The warm, elegant, classic smell is breath taking. It is a heavy scent so a little goes a long way. You will be complimented continuously if you wear this. Its the perfect scent for a sophisticated event or a night out with your significant other. The smell last all day so no reapplication is necessary. I believe this to be a fragrance for a woman over 30 as it has a full bodied sophisticated smell. It's pricey but this formula is worth the money. You can also get the bottle engraved at some retailers which is what was done for me.<br>Do yourself a favor and buy this beautifully scented amazing perfume.&nbsp;<br>	positif
747	17213377	I am so sensitive to perfumes. And I never really seem to find one that doesn't give me a headache that I'm absolutely in love with. Seems like all the ones I get and love hurt my head. When I got a sample of this I was pleased with the light beautiful scent. I only put a little on, I didn't want to overdo it. It's a lovely fragrance, clean and light. Not too deep or strong I say it's a perfect summer perfume but I think it will easily become my signature scent. I have yet to find one yet!!! It doesn't last full force all day long but the smell sticks with you till the end of the day. You got to check it out!	positif
748	4849133	good value. I really dislike the original Angel Mugler, but for this one, smells beautiful. It says edt but then it lasted on my skin for atleast 6 to 7 hours. I can still smell it on me. It is lighter than the original, but this one smells more sweet like berry. This perfume looks gorgeous and it smells great on my skin. I usually like floral scent, like flowerbomb, daisy, j'adore and black opium. But this one is different from them and I find this scent nice and unique. Too bad it is limited edition, and it only come in that smaller bottle. I wish this one can be one of the refills as well, but its not. I really recomend this fragrance, but its best to test it on your skin first.	positif
749	6248151	Wow. This perfume is amazing. First of all the packaging made this feel like a premuim product and the bottle is an ornament in itself! It looks beautiful on my dressing table as the design is based on a Marc Jacobs Handbag. The perfume is described as woody which I wouldn't normally go for but this scent is warm and rich. It is also very long lasting and will last all day. I actually went swimming with it on and I could still smell a faint fragrance on my wrists. My boyfriend also enjoyed the scent. I would definitely recommend if buying as a gift or for treating yourself. I will be treating myself to another bottle when this one runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
750	6248166	This is the first perfume from Marc Jacobs that I have ever used and I am very impressed. To sum it up, I love this fragrance! Not only does the bottle look amazing on my dressing table, it also smells great. The scent is very glamorous, almost woody and long lasting, hence I prefer it as an evening rather than a day to day scent. I have had many compliments from both men and women since wearing it and I will definitely be buying this product again. The only negative is that even in the 30ml size the bottle is quite bulky and heavy so I won't be carrying it around for too long in my handbag! It will just have to stay looking pretty on my dressing table. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
751	5599851	My favourite scent has been 212 for probably over a decade now... not anymore... this scent is absolute perfection! It's very unique and earthy. I can't see me loving anything more than this.I spray this around 6:30am and can still smell it at 4pm after work -- so the longevity definitely plays a part in the price. Smells very similar to the Tom Ford Neroli fragrance... so I think the Neroli is the main note in this. I'm very sensitive to perfume; anything overly sweet or floral will trigger migraines, but have no issues whatsoever with this.	positif
752	7838465	Oh my this smell!!!! So seductive and warm. I love the bottle too. It's a little edgy and wears well throughout the day. Price is pretty average compared to other high end fragrances. I usually find my perfumes at Sephora. This is my first YSL scent and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. 	positif
753	19626191	Smell good Like this better than the perfume.It's light and does not dry out your hair and the scents lasts.But I do wish they would make a new fragrance more of a true gourmande scent maybe they can call it black opium black out.Leave the floral notes out.And also I hope to see a scrub and a body powder.	positif
754	22749235	I love this scent! It's delicious, and lasted all day long. Fragrances tend to give me a headache and this one hasn't yet! I also have very long days, and even after 16-20 hours, by the time I get home I can still smell the perfume. I'm so happy with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
755	24544562	Beautifully smelling, pleasant, sweet. long-lasting fragrance. The scent will last up to 5 hours on me at pressure points which isn't bad. Simple, elegant bottle packaging, though I wish the sprayer were a bit larger to grasp. Would buy again as it is one of my favorite daily go-to perfumes in the summer especially.	positif
756	10660193	"This is the perfect fragrance for the woman who wants to smell classy and elegant. It's a great scent for the fall and winter. Yes, its higher in price but well worth it because the potency goes a long way with 1-2 sprays and it lasts all day/night. It's truly just a perfume that makes any woman ""feel pretty""."	positif
757	11249075	This is the best fragrance ever if you like sweet smells. I'm obsessed with this perfume and cannot find anything like it. This has been my scent for the past 4 years and I won't ever change it. It's super long lasting and very strong, one spray goes a long way. I feel woman of all ages can wear this one! Love love love!!!	positif
758	7819444	Yes! This is one of my favorite scents in my fragrance collection. This is not my every day perfume but something when I'm feeling happy and dressed up a bit during the day. Lasts long, even if you think you don't smell it you'll get a compliment from someone walking by. Such a beautiful, feminine scent.	positif
759	10516056	My favorite perfume for sure. I got this as a gift last Christmas and still use it every day. The scent is light, floral, and feminine, but it lasts all day. I apply 2 sprays per day, and still smell like the fragrance by 5pm. I will definitely purchase this after I'm done with my current bottle.	positif
760	10516403	I love this fragrance, I don't own a full bottle yet but I got a couple sample bottles and I love the way it smells so much! Perfumes are always kind of pricey so I would suggest buying used off of eBay for a better deal but this light florally scent is a must have for a woman in her young 20s.	positif
761	17572235	Love, love, love!! I like a fragrance that last all day on me and this does just that. So many people ask me what perfume I'm wearing when i wear this, it's has quite a fruity smell to begin with but not sickly sweet and then mellows down to a darker woody scent with a hint of vanilla. It's pretty pricey but worth every penny in my opinion!	positif
762	10543771	I love this perfume. It works really well with my body chemistry but I think it would work well for a lot of people. It has a really warm and cozy smell in my opinion but not so much that you would consider it an exclusively night time fragrance. I got it as a sample from my scent bird then when I ran out decided I really had to get the full size from my local Sephora.	positif
763	4978525	One of the best smelling perfumes I've ever owned. You will not regret this purchase. So feminine and sensual. The blackcurrant in this gives it such a beautiful fragrance. My husband is always saying you smell beautiful when I wear this. You will not regret purchasing this!! Perfect everyday scent but also wonderful for a date night or quiet evening with your man.	positif
764	6253605	I don't often wear perfume so I can't comment on other reviews that it smells similar to other brands, however I really loved the scent of this perfume. It is floral, fruity and simply delicious. As it is quite a subtle fragrance it's suitable for any occasion including day to day and evening. We also received the men's version and the two go very well together in my opinion !	positif
765	18840163	This used to be my favourite perfume for summer time. I loved smelled the fruity, floral sweetness all day long. This perfume is concentrated so you only need one or 2 sprays to last you throughout the day; making this a great buy. This is a must have fragrance for all collections it’s a one of a kind luxury scent for all ages!	positif
766	24782620	I am very picky when it comes to fragrances, I do not like strong perfumes and with most I can smell the odor of alcohol. I first tested this in the store to see how it would smell on me, I kept getting a whiff of it afterwards and fell in love. This perfume has a soft, sweet scent that’s different than anything I’ve ever smelled!	positif
767	17713424	I love juicy, specially their perfumes they are one of the top 5 brands that i love. What I love most about this fragrance is the glamorous packaging, and the marshmallow vanilla smell scent that just gets into you! This perfume was limited idk if they changed that, i would recommend this to girls who like vanilla scented perfumes.	positif
768	15155326	Okay, this smells amazing. I'm sorry my nose isn't super honed-in to pick out individual scents like some kind of perfume sommelier. But, I can tell you that a little bit goes a long way with this fragrance. If you're especially sensitive to fragrance, just a spray will do. More could give you a headache. The scent stays put, as well.	positif
769	15299314	I loved the packaging and shape of the bottle. The fragrance is very fresh and you get a sweet yet earthy scent. It is not a smell I would usually buy but once on and settled on the skin I really liked it. I will definitely be buying this perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
770	14306274	I absolutely adore this perfume. It's my treat to myself when I wear this. It almost smells like floral gums. These little fragrances sweets I loved as a child. I think the packaging is very pretty too. It's light, floral but has a powerful punch. It's just the perfect scent for summer and light for daily wear.	positif
771	17296946	This is a very sophisticated and addicting fragrance.<br /><br />This is one of the best perfumes I have ever tried, and it has a musky yet feminine scent. The scents are from Mandarin, Pink Pepper, Peach, Lilac, Geranium, Amber, and Patchouli. It makes you smell rich and feel a little naughty. I definitely recommend!	positif
772	18073854	i got the smaller spray size and once i run out ill for sure get the fullsize! this fragrance is super soft and sweet with little kick. i normally dont like sweet floral perfumes but saint smells so good with my natural oils. im pretty sure you can mix this scent with sinner. and i would say this is a good fragrance for all year round.	positif
773	5929462	Honestly...whether this product works or not I think must have a lot to do with body chemistry, like how the exact same perfume can smell different on each individual. For me, both this and the original lavanila does work wonderfully. I apply once at night very lightly after my shower (best on clean skin says the website!) and reapply in morning before I get on with my day. No touch ups needed. 5- stars for the orignal lavanila because:- I prefer the creamy solid feel of the original, glides well, doesn't irritate freshly shaven pits- fragrance lasts longer, important to me because I work in a scent-sensitive environment where perfume is frowned upon and this very subtle scent allows me to cheat just a tiny bit and really only I can smell it, unless I hug someone :) 4- stars for this sport luxe version because:- this is more of a gel solid and just wasn't crazy about the gel solid feel of this, because it made me feel temporarily sticky, had to fan my underarms and hold them out for a bit to help it dry down- This scent is definitely sportier and I quite like it, but the scent doesn't last as long as the original formulation Both formulas have good and healthy ingredients, and are great at odour control for me. Even after a very sweaty workout, apparently I have zero BO. The ONLY thing that smells is my super sweaty headband (weird huh?). So to really put the deos to the test, I smeared some all around my headband prior to my next workout, and voila, zero odour. Yup. It works VERY well for me!	positif
774	11069961	This was my first Givenchy perfume I ever bought! I love the love last ability and wear it has. The smell is simply heavenly. I purchased it at my local Dillard's. The scent it's floral and sweet with a hint or richness. I purchased the lotion as well it helps to keep the fragrance on longer. I would most likely recommend this for a great gift for someone special!	positif
775	4923351	Beautiful, clean, feminine, sophisticated fragrance that smells divine. To my almost 44 year-old nose, the rose notes smell absolutely divine -- rosy and powdery yet clean without being overly sweet. I think this is one of those perfumes that can be worn by young and old alike...it's a classic scent that is long-lasting and will have you feeling pretty all day.	positif
776	10532350	My husband surprised me with this for Christmas. I cannot begin to describe the scent of this perfume. Its refreshing and so easy to wear all day long. I spray it for work at 6am and my 6pm, I can still smell it on my skin. Its gentle for the sensitve noses and yet strong enough to last all day. I just simply adore this fragrance.	positif
777	4801885	good value. This scent is so romantic! It smell really nice & I got a lot of compliments on my perfume the day I tried it out. I'm still very loyal to the original Romance but so nice to add this to part of my fragrance collection! I received a sample size from influenster for review purposes!	positif
778	10542559	This was my first perfume I ever purchased. It smells so fresh and you only need a little to get the full effect. I'm not good at describing fragrances and all the notes but I can tell you that this scent is heavenly and definitely something you should sniff if you pass it at an ULTA or a department store.	positif
779	24298468	This fragrance really smells nice. A little bit sweet a little bit floral. It’s the perfect girly scent. It does not last the longest but I don’t even mind I just keep a rollerball in my purse. Every time I wear this one I get compliments. And it’s one of the more affordable ones out there! Lovely perfume!	positif
780	17079529	I really enjoyed the smell, it just didn't last as long time as I wanted. I never tried it before till now, nor have I heard of the product... the bottle look nice, it's like my channel perfume. The scent isn't as strong as I wish it would be. I don't think it's my good to fragrance 	positif
781	16546193	A nice perfume with a mix of sweet scents and florals. It's a very delicate scent so I personally feel you need to apply a lot to really smell it. It also isn't very long lasting so I typically have to re-apply at some point during the day. It's definitely a day fragrance with a spring and summer vibe. 	positif
782	5128725	I love JHAG not a perfume scent. I like the fact that it is different and unlike most of the other popular fragrances out there. I tried this one, and while it does smell very good, it is too similar to other perfumes out there. I can't put my finger on which one, but it smells like a Victoria's Secret perfume that I had owned in the past.	positif
783	5116862	Working at Sephora, I'm slowly getting into fragrance more and I got this randomly as a sample when I did an online order and omgggg I love it. To me it smells like chocolate?? But not like obvious chocolate and dessert type of scent. It smells so warm and elegant. I love any perfume with amber in it.	positif
784	19998958	I love ALL Marc Jacobs fragrances! I'm a fresh, flower, fruit scent lover. Everyone of his perfumes smell fresh and last a very long time.

785	20012914	Such a beautiful, beautiful, fragrance! Not only does it smell wonderful, LOOK AT ITS PACKAGING! ???? It has it own, amazing smell, but all of the Marc Jacobs fragrance's have a scent like no other! This perfume is great for ANY time of the year, but I love it best in spring! Definitely worth the price!	positif

795	12415126	This scent has somewhat of a sentimental value to me...this was my first introduction to perfumes as a child...my mom's signature fragrance and needless to say high end perfume has been a lifelong indulgence of mine.This fragrance is timeless to me...not sweet or pungent..not offensive to the nose a clean fresh smell with a not so subtle hint of sophistication! Like a fine champagne!	positif
796	24279934	This is a sweet fragrance but it has a sense of sophistication to it so it’s not like a Juicy Couture perfume or Prada Candy. It’s sweet and sexy and lasts all day. It’s also nice because you can smell it but it doesn’t have an over powering scent. Yves Saint Laurent Mon Paris Eau de Parfum	positif
797	19558313	I got the YvesSaintLaurent fragrance for men for my husband. I loved the scent from the first time I tried it while trying to shop for a perfume for him. It is very distinct, classic and smells expensive.You will love just as I did.Has a dry crisp feel on the skin.	positif
798	4871298	good value. The scent is unique, but at the same time a true classic spring and summer fragrance! It smells luxurious and great on everyone. I keep one on my counter and one in my purse. The new oil took perfume to another level! when I layer the oil and perfume, it lasts even longer than perfume alone.	positif
799	4871399	Hands down the best fragrance I have ever had! This is the only perfume I ever buy! I really hate how strong some scents are but this flowerbomb is the only one I can tolerate without getting a headache...and it smells so lovely and soft everyone you walk pass will be graced by this scent lol love it all time fav ;)	positif
800	4871661	I received a sample of this perfume and it smells so amazing...I'm not a huge floral scent type of girl but this fragrance has a nice balance and is not too heavily floral...love how it last throughout the day and goes well with my body chemistry - highly recommend this, and I'm buying a bottle soon!	positif
801	4871775	good value. Viktor and Rolf Flower Bomb Perfume is undoubtedly one of the best perfumes I've ever smelled! The scent is incredibly luxurious and lasts for most of the day whenever I wear it. It's great for a day at the office, or a night out on the town! I've gone through countless samples and roller balls of this beautiful fragrance and would highly recommend it!	positif
802	5068910	I picked this out as my sample on accident as I thought it was perfume, not cologne. Surprisingly, I LOVED it on me! I think this should be a unisex fragrance. It smells divine on me and cannot stop smelling myself. I actually haven't tried Flowerbomb, and may later, but for now, this is MY scent.	positif
803	6188596	reusable, travel-friendly, long lasting. I received a fragrance sample from Viktor & Rolf. The Jasmine Twist and perfume was my favorite of the three. It smelled sensual and energetic. The scent stayed with me through most of the day. I thought the twist oil with the perfume worked the best. Mixing the oil with a different perfume or the perfume with a different oil would be a great idea.	positif
804	7824496	I've loved many perfumes in my lifetime but have only claimed 2 as my signature scent ... The 1st was Calvin Klein Euphoria & the 2nd was Givenchy Angel & Demon (sp?). I switched back & forth between those 2 for years (Aqualina Pink Sugar gets an honorable mention) until I was in Sephora with a friend & decided to sniff the perfume in the pretty pink bottle with rose gold accents. I think my eyes may have rolled in the back if my head! This has been my favorite fragrance since it was released years ago and I am probably on my 5th bottle now of the original scent (there are seasonal and special edition ones out as well). I feel that this a very feminine scent but is somehow seductive and smells great throughout the day. I usually only need a light spritz and I am complimented all day long. Its light enough for the work day in the office but is also sultry enough for an evening out. My husband loves it and doesn't mind rebuying it for me and he has even bought the male counterpart: Spicebomb (which I LOVE on him.) Scents are hard to recommend to people as everyone is usually particular but I would recommend this to someone who is looking for something different and is not usually into the Estee Lauder/Britney Spears/Paris Hilton type scent	positif
805	7825321	Love This Spring Light fragrance! It smells amazing and Isn't overbearing at all. If you are looking for a perfect spring and summery perfume this is that scent you've been looking for. I love the packaging it came in a it's in an adorable little bottle very classic and Girly!! Love it and so will you!!	positif
806	14301393	LOVELY perfume! This is actually a floral I like, as I detest most flowery fragrances. It has a mixture of florals, but with a very woody base. It smells warm on me, not cloying. It also has green tea in its base notes, which help to tame the floral nature of this scent. Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!	positif
807	16696262	This is such a great scent and it lasts a very long time after applying. Two sprays and it should be good to go, which is great for any perfume when a little goes a long way and it smells heavenly, floral with a sweet undertone smell. Feminine fragrance that will last a long time even if it is used everyday.	positif
808	18980890	This is my #GiftCrush ! This perfume smells amazing. You can never have too much perfume, and this happens to be one of very few floral scents that I actually like. This is a good fragrance for even the pickiest of people. It is sweet without being too cloying, and floral without being overbearing. Such a beautiful feminine scent. Will always be a favorite!	positif
809	20229294	I honestly think Flowerbomb is my favourite fragrance ever?! It just smells so heavenly both on and off the skin (so it's not just the way it mixes with my natural scent). The only downside to this otherwise perfect perfume is that it is so damn expensive! If I could afford it, it would be my everyday fragrance but for now it will have to stay on the Christmas wishlist.	positif
810	24304140	This is one of my favorite fragrance. Such a soft smell. Just a little bit will last you the whole day. The only bad thing is everyone loves it so they want to buy it right away but what can we do. Good scent are always on demand. I recommend this perfume to anyone that ask me what is a good fragrance for to give as an gift.	positif
811	24654828	Love it! Favorite fragrance! I love Flowerbomb Nectar! I already loved the original and Nectar is like a sweeter version. I have been searching for a scent for my wedding and as soon as I smelled this, i bought it right away and decided this is my wedding smell. Usually my fiancé hates all perfume but he loves this one!	positif
812	13868119	This perfume smells so wonderful. It's soft and it's fresh and it truly smells like a ton of different flowers, but in a really authentic, natural way. Not like a sickly-sweet chemical imitation of floral scents, but like an actual bouquet of fresh flowers in your face. It's a beautiful spring scent, and Replica is quickly becoming one of my favorite fragrance brands.	positif
813	24810045	I liked this perfume. How can I describe it as anything other than a sophisticated sun screen scent that makes me feel like I'm in the Hampton's. It smells so good, but a little too much like sunscreen for my liking. It smells good and is a good beach fragrance, but I don't wan't to buy a perfume exclusively for the beach.	positif
814	17748982	This is the most beautiful winter fragrance i own! The bottle is classic and gorgeous! i got it at Sephora and i will definitely repurchase!! The smell lingers even after a full day and stays on my clothes which most perfumes that i own do not! It has a beautiful pine/ vanilla/ woody scent that i will never get sick of!!	positif
815	4795379	I'm really picky when it comes to perfumes, especially because so many of them just smell like a bunch of chemicals mixed together. I heard great reviews about this fragrance, so I decided to give it a try. The scent is really nice without smelling overly pungent or strong. I will definitely buy La Vie Est Belle again!	positif
816	3283796	I bought this for my Mother with my very first wage. It became my favourite perfume of all time,(over 30 years). The scent is very Alluring and Magical. There is no Fragrance in comparison. It smells Divine at all times,but after Dark,in the evening it seems to take on a new dimension.	positif
817	19517332	This fragrance by Lancôme is one of my favourites. It has a sweet floral scent with notes of vanilla which I absolutely love. It is a bit pricey but totally worth it as it lasts all day and even through into the evening. I always get compliments when wearing it. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who prefers a sweeter smelling fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
818	5112649	This is a fragrance that always remains in my extensive collection. It is sexy without being over the top. It lasts all day. It smells sophisticated without smelling like old lady perfume. I love the warmth of this scent. And the bottle is exquisite- the little glass bow, so pretty. I will always keep this gem in my rotation.	positif
819	24755520	This is my favorite fragrance ever! I can literally identify this scent from anywhere it stands out from all of the others. When I am wearing this hypnotic poison I get random people tell me that my perfume smells amazing. I even had the principal at my school tell me I smell like heaven that's a lot coming from a man haha	positif
820	12748705	This fragrance IS AMAZING!!! Light, floral and powdery scent which lasts all day- it's a little potent so no need to respray yourself and all you need is a spritz. Very feminine, makes me feel sexy. I was once asked by a random guy what perfume I was wearing and that it smelled heavenly.... need I say more? :P	positif
821	10539518	Clinique Happy for Women, I lovvvvveeeeee this fragrance and I find it's smell to be unique for every woman. The best way I can describe the scent is like fresh air with a hint of power. Since I frequently shop Macy's and Nordstrom, I can alway locate my all-time favorite perfume for a great price. Also, there always free samples offered when you purchase, at least most of the time.	positif
822	4825764	I absolutely in love with this fragrance. It is fresh, sexy and very memorable. People at work start to recognize this scent is my signature sent. It has an awesome staying power. The only one minus that I can find is the fact that more and more people start using it (because it is truly an awesome perfume) and as a result it is not an unique smell anymore.	positif
823	4825766	I gave in and bought this fragrance after much debate, and I'm glad that I did. I found it to be much more complex than most fragrances that I currently own. It starts off with a warm/sweet smell, but it fades to a lighter more predominantly warm scent. I love it. It's a beautiful perfume and it is a worthy purchase.	positif
824	7817206	Definitely my most favourite perfume ever! I'm still on my first bottle of this as I try not to waste it too much as I'm in love with this scent. I bought it from the fragrance shop which is a perfume shop in the uk. It's such a sweet, girly smell and so long lasting can still smell it 6 hours later	positif
825	7817462	This perfume since it came out has been one of my top 5. It makes me feel so feminine and sexy as well. The complements that I get are always so about how I smell beautiful, not how the fragrance smells. That is always important to me.  I feel a person should be boned with their scent, and that is when it can become part of your identity. 	positif
826	7838052	Chanel Chance Eau Tandre is my number one perfume. It's a very pricey fragrance, however a bottle will last you over a year. You only need a little bit of product to smell fantastic all day! This scent is very sultry and floral and reminds me of springtime. Chanel is definitely creating some of the best fragrances out there.	positif
827	7838286	This is my signature fragrance! I own about 10 other perfumes, but this is my one true love. The scent is so pleasant and feminine without being too strong. I also have the matching shimmer powder and it pairs together so nicely. My boyfriend also loves it and thinks I smell delicious whenever I wear it! Great fragrance, definitely try it if you like soft, sweet, floral scents.	positif
828	17078133	Love does exist! This is by far the ONLY perfume I splurge on, I usually get it at macys and Sephora. The scent lasts me all day and the fragrance is absolutely amazing, words can't describe how beautiful this smells! Always have and always will continue to purchase this perfume, I recommend this to everyone.	positif
829	17079200	The Chanel range of perfumes is my absolute favourite. This is a beautiful floral scent, but it’s not overly floral where by it’s over powering & smell like you’ve bathed in pot pourri. I’m a repeat purchaser & love the entire range in the Chanel chance line of fragrances. Defiantly recommend	positif
830	18147934	I got a deluxe size sample from Sephora. This fragrance smells amazing. It's a classic scent that can be layered. People always ask me what I'm wearing when I wear this perfume! The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is simply the fact that if you spray TOO MUCH, you can start to smell old lady like.	positif
831	24353214	The first time I saw and smelled this fragrance I was so taken a back. It has been a while since I've been impressed or even was interested in perfumes.the scent is somewhat sweet but it doesn't come across too strongly.I received a small sample in a Vouge magazine and immediately looked it up online.	positif
832	7813417	Tasty beginning of violet, peach, pineapple, lemon ...... Changes to the bouquet of my favorite flowers ylang-ylang, jasmine, lily of the valley, hyacinth. Aroma delicate and sophistication ...... Secured musk and sandalwood ...Musk is the sexiest fragrance scent close to the skin, gives a relaxed naturalness perfume and sandalwood - a classic powerful aphrodisiac reinforces its effect on the depth of the subconscious smelled Armani.	positif
833	7836251	This is a fabulous fragrance. It is a very light and beautiful scent. It's bottle is a glass, see-through bottle with a blue colored perfume that is beautiful. It's smell attracts people's attention & they ask you what you're wearing. You can buy this at Macy's, Sephora, Ulta and most other places that sell fine perfumes.	positif
834	5109203	good value. If you are looking for something that is sexy but not ultra feminine, super floral, or has been done/ smells like every other women's perfume - this is it. Such a sexy fragrance. I can't find anything to compare, or that I like more. The scent is long lasting, and stays true to the initial spray. In love with Atelier and their products.	positif
835	4782407	fruity, invigorating, cleansing. Boyfriend bought this for me two weeks ago when I was having a rough patch IRL, and man, am I glad he did! I had originally reviewed the Pomelo Paradis fragrance almost a year ago, finding the scent invigorating and pleasant, but ultimately lacking in staying power. I recall thinking at the time, this would make a great bath product, so I was absolutely over the moon when I received this in the mail. It really is a great shower gel. The scent is a bright, slightly bitter grapefruit - extremely fresh and juicy, like fruit in the warm summer sun. As I continued to wash, the scent became cooler and greener, probably because of the blackcurrant bud and vetiver. It's like smelling the leaves and bark of a citrus tree. As expected, the staying power of the shower gel isn't that great either, but that's why I love it as a gel rather than a fragrance - it doesn't clash with other scents I might want to wear! Atelier's Rose Anonyme shower gel, while also lovely, pretty much only works when layered with the perfume. The Pomelo shower gel you can wear with just about anything, as the scent only lingers for maybe a half hour or so. It's the absolue perfect pick-me-up. I highly recommend that anyone looking for a fresh, fruity summer shower gel give this one a try. Don't be put off by the price point - you only need a bit for a poof, and my previous Rose Anonyme shower gel lasted me for almost two months.	positif
836	24700484	I had to stop wearing perfume recently due to allergies, which is very sad because I love he fragrance world so much. This is one of the ONLY scents that doesn’t give me a migraine. It’s a true, musky, sweet vanilla scent. It smells SO good and even better when layered with Orange Sanguine.	positif
837	15295870	"I can smell the rose note through the perfume instantly. The fruity notes give a ""fizzy"" element to the fragrance. it has strong projection and a few sprays will last you the day. the perfume is beautiful but nothing new that I haven't smelt before. the bottle is simple and classy. Would make a perfect scent to wear on a date."	positif
838	6253673	I've never really been a fan of girly perfume and often opt for the more manly strong scents, I was very pleasantly surprised by this, the lovely fragrance reminded me of passion fruit upon first smell. A long lasting scent which is always good and when you have all day meeting you certainly want to make sure your perfume is noticeable.	positif
839	5142277	My perfume tastes tend to run more towards the floral (Tocca Florence) or just about anything with bergamot, never musk. This fragrance is a lot stronger than ones I normally use, but I really like it and I feel it compliments my own scent. Boyfriend approved it too! It smells almost a little sweet but it wears really well and lasts for most of the day.	positif
840	16083044	This is a perfect fragrance for the holidays! I only love when a perfume nor only smells good but speaks for its self. This fragrance's definitely one of those. It is the perfect scent for a woman who wants to feel feminine, elegant and intense. It is long lasting and perfect for any occasion. A must have for this season!!!	positif
841	23316355	I received this as a sample, and I have never loved a perfume as much as this one. The only think that comes close in my book is the original Saint scent from KvD. This perfume smells elegant and sexy, mature and poised. This is a fantastic fragrance for any age group. Please make a smaller bottle!	positif
842	25763169	beyond amazing. AAAAAMAZING! I had smelled this perfume on a friend, and begged her for days to send me a picture of what the smell was. I have gotten SO many compliments on this fragrance, people have told me my scent is calming, or I smell like cake, or that I smell like an angel! Can't get enough.	positif
843	17853631	I got a sample of the Velvet Teddy perfume in an order from the MAC website. I loved it so much that I bought a full size without even finishing the sample first. It has become my signature scent and I will definitely repurchase time and time again. At first, it's very spicy smelling. Within 15-20 min, the dry-down brings out the sweeter notes. It's like a musky, spicy vanilla. It lasts on my skin ALL DAY. At the end of the day, you're left with a light, sweet scent without spice. I've gotten random compliments on it as well. I do think it's more of a fall/winter scent, but it's a great evening scent year round. Idk what it is but my body chemistry reacts really well to this fragrance. For 57$ and the amount of product you get, this is a better deal than the high end perfumes you see at ULTA. One last thing for others who want a preference reference - I love vanilla, citrus, coconut, and warm scents. I HATE the smell of Jasmine, heady florals, patchouli, ylang ylang, and honeysuckle. If you want to buy Velvet Teddy, I highly recommend going to a MAC counter and spraying it on, then smell it again at the end of the day before finally buying it. Don't listen to the negative reviews and form an opinion yourself please! Everyone has different body chemistry when it comes to perfumes.	positif
844	5083417	I really liked this fragrance when I tested it in-store, but when I actually sprayed it on my body I realized it smells almost exactly like Calvin Klein Endless Euphoria. (Another of my favorites but I only used it last year, and with perfumes I like to go long times without having to smell the same scent.. I know, I'm weird.) I might return this one, not sure yet.	positif
845	5137133	Love this scent. It's pretty mature but not too old lady smelling (for lack of a better term). That being said, I would not recommend buying it from Sephora...I got sticker shock when I saw Sephora's price and bought the exact same perfume for more than 1/2 the price online at Fragrance Net. Save yourself the money and look at different legit fragrance online stores for better deals.	positif
846	25936011	I've always loved this perfume. I used it several years ago until I ran out, and a couple weeks ago I stumbled upon it at Tj Maxx and had to get it. Smelling it is so nostalgic for me! The scent is very feminine, and actually lasts on me. I don't think I'll ever get tired of this fragrance.	positif
847	1820539	"This new fragrance is based on the original Lady Million perfume. It is described as a ""fruity oriental"" fragrance and I would say this is a good description of the scent. The bottle is lovely, it smells gorgeous and lasts a long time. It would make a perfect present or treat for yourself. I would highly recommend it."	positif
848	2487292	This was bought as a Christmas present for my sister who loves the smell of this perfumeits worth paying that bit extra (in my opinion) for a great scent such as this oneand the bottle looks really classy which is an added plus Once on this fragrance lasts for quite a long time but does smell quite strong when first applied(again according to my sister) I would recommend this perfume it arrived promptly and was well packaged	positif
849	11412894	This is my last purchase and so far every single person ask me what perfume I'm using because it just smells great. The exotic and oriental notes makes this fragrance unique. Has a good fixer and it's very feminine. Is the kind of scent that you can't forget. Girl, you have to try it!	positif
850	11412961	I tried this fragrance in a free sample! loved it! I thought the scent choice a free and daring girl!The smell lasts quite a long time,and is revealed in a new light!Sorry the price for me on this perfume is great! and so would definitely have purchased! I recommend to those who are not burdened with financesGoogle ??????????	positif
851	16718130	This perfume is the perfect summer scent. It smells like salted vanilla and a luxury Mediterranean vacation all in one. There's a hint of green mandarin in the opening notes which keeps it fresh and perfect for summer. I always receive so many compliments when I wear this. The rose gold bottle is absolutely stunning and looks so beautiful on my vanity. I highly recommend this fragrance.	positif
852	5618762	I think this is my favorite perfume from Narciso Rodriques. Narciso is gardenia, rose, musk, ceder, and vetiver. On me it turns into this creamy soft gardenia with musk. I love it! I also own the Poudree as I love Jasmine as well. I'm a white floral lover and this was a blind buy as I own a few perfumes from NR. Narciso is my favorite because on me it turns into such a lovely scent it's floral but something about it is so pretty. For me it lasts quite a long time and the sillage is moderate. I like it best after it settles into my skin. I also have recieved compliments when I wear this.I love the bottle the white cube fits this perfume really well. When I wear this it just makes me feel good and when I catch a whiff it just affirms how much I enjoy this scent. I never had a signature scent but between this and the For Her edt I find I wear these 2 scents the most. With Narciso edging out the For Her. I find this to be softer and it's sweet but not in a way where it bothers me its not like sugar. It's like the best flower you can smell mixed with some other goodies. The musk is my favorite thing about Narciso's fragrances they all have musk and I love how it is done in this edp. It's exactly how I like it sweet but clean it's so delish.Wonderful scent that I would most definitely repurchase. Love it!	positif
853	18839372	I have raved about this fragrance to practically everyone I know. It is 100% worth every cent and lasts ALL DAY LONG! I have received a ton of compliments since I started applying this perfume and it has become my everyday scent. With a light, floral tone, it is perfect for everyday use and smells absolutely divine Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Eau de Parfum	positif
854	18842639	The smell of this perfume is so fresh and subtle. It’s fruity with the right hint of floral. It’s the perfect scent for going to work and running errands. The fragrance is long lasting. I really love it. Considering this was a sample I do see myself purchasing it again when I run out!	positif
855	11996670	I love this perfume! It smells so good, and I am picky about fragrance. I was initially attracted to the adorable bottle, but fell in love with the scent. The only complaint I have is that it's a little pricey compared to the other juicy perfume prices. I have this one on my Christmas list and hope Santa brings me some!	positif
856	22815342	I got this perfume from my man ( because I kept dropping hints ????) and I just adore this smell. It smells fruity but sweet and sexual. All in a good way! This is a women who is confident, light on her toes, and just loves life. It’s a beautiful scent, so to smell it!! This also lasts longer on me than the other juicy couture fragrances	positif
857	17826502	This is my absolute favorite scent! Every time I wear this I get compliments on how good I smell. I'm not really a big fan of the whole Viva La Juicy line, but this fragrance is beautiful. It took me a while to locate this perfume, but I finally found it at Sephora. I will definitely be buying Noir for as long as they sell it.	positif
858	25481895	I use this perfume quite often during the day, especially on sunny days. It’s a very sweet fruity smell but without smelling cheap or childish. It’s a really nice summer smell. In my opinion it’s not sophisticated enough to be an evening scent but it’s perfect for a nice daytime fragrance.	positif
859	19049127	A fragrance that will get you noticed with its soft warm smelling scent gorgeous bottle design with the sunset colours. Great price wonderful gift for someone into their perfume... mine has lasted so long as a little goes a long way as it lasts so long, but it’s one I’m always requesting for my birthday most years!	positif
860	12086964	I was so surprised by this scent, I thought it would be simple and ineffective, but it has a wonderful mix of fragrances that are both sweet and deep, and it's definitely powerful. I don't wear a lot of perfume when I put it on, but this one I can smell all day - and I love it!	positif
861	22747235	A surprisingly light fragrance which makes a nice change from any strong fragrances on sale at the moment. This is definitely a perfume that can carry you from the office on a Friday afternoon to post-work dinner/drinks. The sweet scent is smell of the summer that we all crave during the cold winter months! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
862	5392872	This is a very sophisticated and addicting fragrance.This is one of the best perfumes I have ever tried, and it has a musky yet feminine scent. The scents are from Mandarin, Pink Pepper, Peach, Lilac, Geranium, Amber, and Patchouli. It makes you smell rich and feel a little naughty. I definitely recommend!	positif
863	10534526	When I first tried this perfume, Guilty Gucci, years ago I knew this was for me. The scent is not overbearing and not flowery nor do you smell like a citrus fruit. It is very enticing and all you women out there, it is the perfect fragrance. Love it! Long lasting, 2 spritz last you all day.	positif
864	14520681	I don't wear ANY perfume but I am obsessed with this scent!  Got it as a gift for my birthday and the floral smell is so light and airy that I sometimes just spray it on when I want to feel pretty.  It's a very nice staple perfume and I love Gucci's whole collection of fragrances.  	positif
865	4996180	good value. Purchased full size using Sephora Perfume Collection sampler kit. Name says it all, very fresh and slightly citrus-y. So good for summer and I've had many people ask about the scent. I really love Mademoiselle but was tired of the same smell, this is a great way to introduce some variety to your fragrance wardrobe.	positif
866	15271588	This edp is fantastic and if you like Light Blue but just wished it had less citrus and more flowers and musk then I think people will like this. I personally love this scent on me it lasts for hours and the sillage is moderate imo. It's a compliment magnet of a perfume. I get more compliments on this than of any other scents I own. I love musk and this with the Jasmine and Marigold are just lovely. I can smell the apple and it reminds me of the DKNY be delicious line except to me this is a real perfume. It's fresh, floral with a touch of fruit I just love that in a fragrance. The lemon is still there it's just not super pronounced. I prefer edp's to edt's for some reason and I believe this scent is becoming my signature.I wear this daily as it's a great daily scent that is not offensive and I can wear it to so many things. I own many he scents but this is one of my favorites as I love white flowers especially Jasmine. Plus I love scents in the fruity floral range so for me this is a no brainer. Also the fact that it's heavier on the musk is right up my alley. Yes, this perfume is pricey but if you look you can find it for a little less and as time goes on it'll go down. I personally hope D&G never stop making this intense version, I think it's just so lovely! Love this scent so much. :) Recommended.	positif
867	19846507	This scent has been a favorite of mine for quite a while now. I was a little worried it would be too strong for me when I first smelled it since I’m so sensitive to perfumes but it hasn’t bothered me at all. It has a bright, fresh fragrance and it lasts much longer than other perfumes I own. Highly recommend!	positif
868	19821232	Love this scent. I got it in my Sephora play box and then bought it. It’s a floral clean light smell and I seem to get compliments on it. The price is not too steep for a Burberry fragrance. I usually wouldn’t rebuy perfume since I like to mix it up but I may make an exception for this one	positif
869	25895988	"Philosophy's Pure Grace is my all-time favorite perfume! Its my signature scent. So many perfumes claim to smell ""clean"", but have too much of a synthetic odor. Not this one! Fresh, clean and simple. PURE! This isn't expensive at all compared to most fragrances. If you're like me and you hate smelling like food, flowers or sweetness, you must try this!"	positif
870	6090026	Just tried Saint by Kat Von D, the first of her fragrances I've ever tried. I love the combination of scents. The Vanilla and Plum make it great for everyday and the Musk and Caramel notes allow it to move into evening when you need to freshen up and don't have time to stop home and apply a heavier perfume. Great scent that will smell good on almost everyone!	positif
871	6179807	Oh my god! Kat Von D did a great job with these scents! I have yet to find another fragrance than my juicy Noir perfume, which is my go to. It smells like flowers with a scent of vanilla (to me anyways). One spritz goes A LONG WAY! I might have found a second favorite perfume. SINNER is awesome as well!	positif
872	6179984	I've very very specific about the perfumes I wear, they have to last all day long, and they eventually all fade but I like for the under tone in fragrances to smell nice to! Thankfully this smelled amazing! I recieved it complimentary for reviewing purposes and I can honestly say I love it! Warm, light, pretty scent!	positif
873	6180042	Oh yes! I love this!! Saint is my favorite it is a very sweet fragrance. On me, I get a lot of caramel and a lot of vanilla. It becomes a creamy vanilla and sandalwood skin scent. Definitely a pleasant smelling perfume. Received the Saint & Sinner fragrances complimentary for review purposes. Really enjoying both but Saint is definitely my fave.	positif
874	6218996	I recieved this product as a free sample for reviewing purposes. Although I love the Saint fragrance, the Sinner was just as good! It smells more warmer, and is a more sexier fragrance. Its scent lasted for majority of the day, & I found a new perfume that I'm gonna purchase in a bigger bottle next time!	positif
875	17080730	I received a trial size version of Kat Von D Sinner Eau de Parfum in a Vox Box from Influenster which came as a surprise in the mail. This perfume smells absolutely amazing and the scent is long lasting. Out of the Saint & Sinner fragrances, this is my favorite by far! I have recommended this perfume to all of my friends since!	positif
876	5180944	This cream is very nice. I like the way my skin looks in the morning, but it's not suuuuper hydrating for my combination skin. I don't understand people's comments on the fragrance. My jar smells a little chemically and very faint, not perfumed at all. I don't mind the scent- it's pretty blah and fades instantly.	negatif
877	18453869	I'm not a great at smelling or describing smells but the one thing about this fragrance that stands out to me is that I can use just one spritz and it lasts all day long. Normally when I use perfume I lose the scent a couple of hours into wear, but I can smell this one on me all day long. It has serious staying power.	positif
878	5109257	Smells wonderful and works very well. I like all of the fragrances and find they do not interfere with other perfume. For exercise or outdoor summer activities in the humidity, I switch to the Sport version, which helps a bit more, though it's my least favorite scent of them all. Lavanila deodorant is expensive, so I stocked up during VIB.	positif
879	18516772	I have al Rehabs Golden Sand first and that smells just like Prada Candy so if you want a cheaper alternative or a dupe imo. Go with al Rehabs Golden Sand it is so similar I mix the 2 so the Candy lasts longer on my skin. It does last but it becomes a skin scent pretty quickly. I love the way this smells though! I love caramel and benzoin vanilla is just so yummy. This is also a great cold weather scent I love wearing it in this type of weather it really shines in the cold if you ask me. I love the packaging on this and I had bought the 3 piece set and ended up giving the roller ball to my sister because she really loves this fragrance too. Itâ€™s very expensive and I wish it lasted longer and had better sillage. But I like a loud scent this is more demure and thatâ€™s just fine. It doesnâ€™t detract any lippies because the scent itself is very well done. I love this on me it dries down into a spicy powdery vanilla musk which I love. As a musk lover I really wanted to try this and it does not disappoint. This is such a warm, lovely fragrance that Iâ€™m really enjoying for the cold months. Also the vanilla in this smells so good this really is a lovely perfume.	positif
880	10542096	I'm pretty new to the perfume world, but so far this is one of my absolute favorite perfumes! I received it as a sample in an Ulta order and have been obsessed with it ever since! It is definitely a sweet smelling scent, so you won't like it if sweet isn't your thing.However, if you do like sweet scented fragrances TRY THIS!	positif
881	17799727	I received this Prada candy kiss in my Sephora Favorites Perfume Sampler and I loved everything about it! It smells really nice, very high end sweetness. The bottle is like jewelry and is probably worth the 1.0 fl oz exchange rate; however I went with a different fragrance. I still may pick this up sometime though. FYI the scent stays with you.	positif
882	5616479	good value, travel-friendly. Subtle yet gorgeous essence of rose - the smell of rose is obviously the strongest layer of scent. I have tried many perfumes across my lifetime and have only recently found this fragrance; it is subtle yet its statement is definitive. Perfect perfume, hope to continue to wear it for years to come.	positif
883	15415292	I'm in LOVE with this fragrance, it's my go to everyday scent. It's a very sophisticated Musky Floral Clean smell. I'm usually into my very sweet smelling fragrances and even though this is a very clean, romantic perfume it still has a subtle sweet tone. I can't express enough how much I love the Chloe Fleur De Parfum.	positif
884	16081022	I found my favorite rose fragrance!!!! I love this, it's so light but so beautiful. Not overly scented where you smell like a garden, but enough to make it sexy, elegant, floral and sophisticated. Wish it came in a stronger, more long lasting scent but this is going to stay one of my top 5 favorite perfumes!	positif
885	14028046	This body lotion is very nice. If you don't like strong scents then this is probably not for you; however, if you like clean perfume scents that are somehow floral you are going to enjoy this product. I personally really like the scent, I use the scrub that has this same fragrance and then the lotion and I feel that I smell great all day long!	positif
886	16231244	Ordinarily I would never consider wearing a fragrance that wasn't a designer brand. (Insert embarrassed to admit that face here :/ ) However after trying these after being bought them as a gift, I have never received so many compliments about my scent! They smell unbelievable and they have more staying power than a lot of high end perfumes I've tried.	positif
887	7821163	If you are looknig for a perfume or a fragrance that will leave your skin smelling like a fresh garden, then this is the choice for you. With a incredibly sweet and sort of bitter scent at the same time, damped into a prominent smmell of fresh flowers, is one of my favorite perfumes. You definately will smell like a dream!	positif
888	7822453	Classic scent! I always have one in my collection although I don't wear it every single day I love it. I usually purchase the spring edition of daisy every year as well and those smell amazing!! The lasting power of the perfume is there some Marc Jacobs scents don't last but that problem doesn't exist with this fragrance	positif
889	10537812	I absolutely love fragrances by Marc Jacob yet this one is not my favorite that much. I do like it alot but it can easily smell cheap at times because its easy to over do it when spraying it. It js perfect though for evening. It has a sexy, sensual scent that does smell beautifilly. I dont think it lasts very long compared to other MJ perfumes sadly	positif
890	18062720	I tried this scent as a sample and i have absolutely fallen in love with it! It really is a must try! I sprayed a small amount on before going to work in the morning and everyone asked what the beautiful fragrance i was wearing was. I could still smell it hours later unlike alot of other top brand perfumes. I definitely recommend x	positif
891	25932192	This is one of my TOP perfumes! Wear this and you’ll definitely stand out. I feel that it’s perfect for any season but more of a night/special occasion fragrance. Smells floral but also somewhat sweet. The dry down smells very fresh to me. It’s a very distinct scent and once you smell it you’ll know if someone else is wearing it.	positif
892	18442359	This is a wonderful classic and elegant fragrance, it reminds me of a beautiful summers day! it's a very light perfume, that's smells wonderfully fruity. The product does not dissapoint, it lasts all day unlike other perfumes I've worn. I would recommend to all ages it really is a timeless scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
893	11996437	My favourite fragrance I have ever owned! This fragrance is fresh and clean smelling. Being a unisex scent it smells great on both genders and adapts to your natural ph levels. It's super great value for money and can be picked up fairly cheaply. I would recommend this perfume to someone who wants to smell fresh and ready for summer!	positif
894	14824045	this is my fave fragrance of all time i love everything Calvin Klien. yes this perfume is long lasting i get compliments through out the whole day. how does it compare well the scent is more of a womanly smell and its longevity is crazy. all high end perfumes are pricey for the fact that they smell good and last long. i would certainly recommend go get it!	positif
895	4925670	good value. I initially got this in a Travalo bottle in April 2015 from another shop when I went in and asked for a light, fresh scent to wear on my wedding day, but in all of the excitement, I completely forgot to write it down. I've spent a year trying to track this down -- bringing the last few drops into various shops and hoping someone would be able to help me find it. I said all I knew was that I asked for something fresh and that it reminded me of a lily of the valley perfume I had once, but no one was able to figure it out. I went on Fragrantica looking for fresh and aquatic smells with some kind of lily, and then I went to Sephora with my list. The instant I sprayed this, I knew I'd found my scent. (Considering the ridiculous popularity of this scent, I'm shocked no one was able to identify it!) I probably smelled 50+ other fragrances looking for this, and none of them come close to the beauty and freshness of L'Eau d'Issey. I think the combination of lily of the valley and melon is so lovely and springy. It seems to have wonderful staying power, and while the scent changes over the course of a day, it's always pleasant. I'm ecstatic to have finally found my wedding fragrance again -- each time I wear it, I'm flooded with wonderful memories, which just makes it even more delightful.	positif
896	12407980	My mom introduced me to this brand and I have been in love ever since. She got the mens fragrance for my boyfriend and it instantly became his favorite! its a cool scent and ends on high notes, well at least on my skin. It has a lingering smell and you feel good using it because a few sprays actually last all day. this is for perfume fans!	positif
897	4874719	pleasant, delightful. I received this for free to write an honest review. I'm normally not much for perfume, but this smells delightful! It's a light smell, not overly heavy. It also smells floral, with a hint of musk. I can't stand the rose smelling perfume, this is a pleasant floral fragrance. I think I've found my new scent!	positif
898	10534003	I got this as a sample and I really liked the sweet scent. It's a young, romantic fragrance. Although it smells amazing, I feel like it's meant for the 18-30 age range, something a younger woman would wear during Spring or Summer. I would definitely recommend it to someone who prefers sweet perfume.	positif
899	10534047	It is really hard for me to find a fragrance. I have really bad allergies so anything too scenty will have me sneezing all day along with give my a runny eyes &nose.Tender Romance smelled amazing! It is a light noticeable scent that smells clean. It will have your special someone getting closer to get a better smell! Perfect for work, going out, date night. It reminds me of a pheromone perfume	positif
900	10534063	I am loving the scent of this fragrance! I don't like strong 'perfumey' smells, and this is perfect for spring and summer. It is sweet, yet musky at the same time. I don't know how they did it! I am very sensitive to smells, but this doesn't bother me at all. I would definitely buy this and recommend it.	positif
901	10535723	I have always loved Ralph Lauren fragrances for men. The Polo Red Extreme lasts a VERY long time. My husband sweats like a pig and you can still feel the scent. I secretly apply it to his clothes hanging in the closet. :) That way our room would smell fantastic. Thanks to Influenster I was able to try this new perfume for free in exchange of my honest review. 	positif
902	17314627	This fragrance from right here is my very favorite perfume! I really love the way it smells, its like an in-between the sweet and the citric. Perfect for day and night, for teenagers or grown-ups. <br />The price is according it scent because it lasts all day long and smells amazing. <br />You can get it at a mall or a fragrance store.	positif
903	5172355	I received a sample of this perfume in my Sephora Play! box. I do not like this fragrance. I don't want to give it a low review just because the smell isn't for me. It lasts a really long time and has a very strong floral scent. Only 1 or 2 sprays are needed.	positif
904	22667477	This perfume is definitely a great summer go to! It's not too heavy but lasts a long time and it smells better the longer you wear it. As a perfume addict I'm a huge fan of Tom Ford because his fragrances are high quality and a little goes a long way! This reminds me of suntan lotion, sunshine, beach and sand! Its my new signature summer scent!	positif
905	12408734	I really love the scent of this perfume. It's long lasting and persistent, you can smell the fragrance on your body after the all day. I think that this fragrance it's perfect for spring. I used a little sample and I want to buy the full size. I also like the packaging, I think it's really unique.	positif
906	10528287	This was the first perfume I ever bought and I absolutely loved it! It smells light, airy, fresh and beautiful! I am someone who is picky about fragrances, and I tend to get board of the scents but I still love this scent! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves a good perfume that isn't overly powerful.	positif
907	10557193	I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this fragrance. I'm happy I received it in my Charm box from Influenster.I do not like perfumes as a general rule..they're usually too musky for me. There's enough of floral notes on top that I can rock this scent. It's fresh and light with a moderate lasting smell.	positif
908	20212293	I received a small sample for review in a voxbox, all opinions are my own. It was a small perfume sample but I only needed one or two sprays on my body and the scent lasts a good while. It smells so fresh and light, like an early spring morning with birds chirping around you. I wish Vera Wang wasn't so pricey or else I would buy a full bottle of the fragrance.	positif
909	22852157	This fragrance is more of a floral woody musk smell. Definitely has a women's touch with a soft inviting more masculine scent that bodies the perfume very well. Overall i would definitely purchase this perfume and recommend it for more mature women. The smell is for a very sophisticated, and structured women, who likes a strong lasting perfume. **I received this product complimentary for testing purposes	positif
910	15428291	Vera Wang is one of my fave perfume brands. This products has sweet, fruit, light and feminine scent. It stays quite long on clothes. I usually gather my laundry on the weekend and I can still smell the fragrance that I sprayed a few days ago. The package is really nice too, the bottle is transparent and the lid is flowery and it goes well with each other.	positif
911	5919156	I bought this without trying it first in the store. At first I thought the scent was too musky and strong but only moments after spraying it on the beautiful smell turned into a floral powdery wonderful kind of fragrance that I have fallen in love with. No wonder Princess Diana wore this type of perfume. A fragrance to wear every season. I love it.	positif
912	18517361	This lovely fragrance was my daily go to scent for summer 2017. After wearing the deliciously tenacious Angel Muse over the winter, I was ready to try a soft and pretty scent in the spring. While having a classic fragrance is cool, it is also fun to mix it up according to the seasons or your mood. I enjoy tart and sour foods and I love the initially sharp vegetal notes of this fragrance. I find this â€œgreenâ€ note at the beginning refreshingly different. I like that the tartness is vegetal instead of fruity berries, such as in Euphoria which Iâ€™ve worn, just for a change of pace. I wish this rhubarb note lasted longer, but I can live with the brevity because then this cologne turns into the prettiest rose scent. Itâ€™s not a sexy rose like Stella, another one of the perfumes that I own, but an elegant, fresh and soft rose scent that makes me happy. Since this is a cologne, I spray myself four times in the morning (and I can still feel comfortable entering a crowded elevator if I have to) and I can usually smell the slightest trace of it on my skin by the end of work day. In terms of the packaging, red and black are my favourite colours, along with gold, so I love this cologneâ€™s bright red bottle and rounded black stopper. I think the bottle is super simple, yet sophisticated and fun. It was also fun to open an orange Hermes box for the first time in my life. ;-)	positif
913	23700329	Actually my dad owes this perfume. First 5 minutes it stinks that bad that I want to jump out of the window. In 5-10 minutes the perfume combines with the skin and all those processes and it reveals its real scent. It smells so calming, warm and male like. I adore this perfume on dad and every single time he wears it I get so distracted by the fragrance	positif
914	13222590	This mask's perfumey scent is absolutely to die for! This is my first time trying Lush's Rosy Cheeks face mask and I am thoroughly impressed by it. It is on the pricey side, but you can't beat that fragrance. It smells just like a rose garden. There is no room for improvement on perfection. ;) Lush always gets it right when it comes to skin care! 	positif
915	19812190	Carmex has been a chapstick brand that I have been using for a long time now. Carmex hydrates and smooths my lips so that they won’t be dry and chapped. The smell of carmex is really nice because knowing that it doesn’t really have a scent makes me believe that it will work even better because it doesn’t have to perfume fragrance that will damage lips. 	positif
916	10514074	I swear this is the best fragrance around. It's a light sweet, sexy scent. It's not over powering but you can ßtill smell iacross the room. I highly recommend this perfume.it js affordable and it will ladt you a long timw. Ive had mine flr six months already and it's only half way gone	positif
917	10556975	First, I love Bath & Body Works. It is my go to place for perfumes. But Pink Chiffon and A Thousand Wishes is literally my favortie fragrance from the store. They smell amazing, the smell last forever. Even after you take a shower, there is still a faint scent of the perfume on your body. I highly recommend getting perfume from Bath & Body Works?	positif
918	13193520	This is a very light, summer smelling fragrance. Personally, it reminds me of being on vacation. However, I do love how easy it is to rub in, it doesn't leave my skin sticky afterwards, and the scent stays on my skin all day (perfect for when I don't want to wear perfume). I would definitely buy again!	positif
919	24339568	I absolutely love this mist, if you are into sweet fragrance but you don't want to smell like a candy shop this is for you, it is sweet but sutil, has a little of everything but in the right way has fruits notes and you can smell some flowers too and when it dries has sweet scent, the stain power it is not like a perfume but it is pretty decent.	positif
920	14385641	After smelling several fragrances at Nordstrom, I chose this one because it was fresh, fruity, and floral. Also, it wasn't overly popular, and I like having my own scent. I really like the simple, glass bottle with the lavender perfume inside. I was able to grt the kit with the lotion and body wash, as well, for almost the same price as just the perfume.	positif
921	23330487	Sweet, and sexy perfume I received the Juliette Has A Gun fragrance set as a gift. I wasn’t sure about MMMM...at first. I thought it was very sweet smelling, but after the perfume had a chance to mix with my body chemistry, I was blown away. It’s a very sweet and sexy scent. I had to buy the full sized product! I absolutely love it!!	positif
922	25863016	This kit is great! Firstly the larger size of Juliette Has a Gun Not A Perfume Eau de Parfum Spray is good for layering, and it’s a fantastic light scent. Everything in the kit is long lasting, strong smelling and I don’t dislike any of the scents included. A fabulous kit to test out fragrance!	positif
923	14303337	I guarantee that you will love this perfume. It has the cleanest and most refreshing scent of any perfume I have ever owned. The price is comparable to most higher end fragrances but this seems to last longer than most of my other perfumes. I wear this perfume year around! It even smells so good that I don't mind carrying around the full sized bottle in my purse daily!	positif
924	14303419	"Okay,lemme just tell you that this perfume thats "" not a perfume"" is heavenly! Juliette has a gun Not a perfume is a bold but still subtle enough not to overwhelm scent that smells lovely. Its feminine, spicy notes linger on your skin for hours and keeps everyone asking ""what perfume are you wearing?"" Tell them ""its Not a perfume"" and turn them on to this amazing fragrance!#musesofinstagram"	positif
925	4789080	This was one of the 1st perfumes I bought when I first became a fragrance junkie and it's been one of my favs ever , a little goes a long way and I can smell it on me but it isn't overbearing or load at all it's a very nice scent and will continue to buy as long as it's available	positif
926	5081060	Dolce&Gabbana has been making this stuff for YEARS, and somehow it is still a best-seller. This fragrance is not as fruity, nor as strong as most other perfumes are. The scent is strong when you first apply it, but throughout the day it becomes more settle and smells amazing. Great fragrance for a great price.	positif
927	25327127	wonderfully surprised! I received a sample of this with my last order. The description that came with it said “luxurious and floral with soft, sweet, milky notes.” What a great description! I put it on and a little later asked my boyfriend to sniff my arm, and his response was “hmmm...smells like you.” I love and own all types of perfumes (floral, gourmand, citrus, etc, etc) and for him to say that really surprised me because I don’t have anything that smells just like this. For the first time in quite some time with a new fragrance, I actually found myself smelling my wrist because I loved the scent and not just to see if I actually liked it as it developed with my chemistry over time. It’s definitely a lighter not in your face scent. The floral part of it is mellow and lovely. The “sweet milky notes” have a sweet coconut creamy, almond milky touch to it that warms the scent nicely. The coconut, as others have mentioned, is not pina colada sunscreen, but more of a natural coconut. This would be a great summer scent, but versatile enough to wear any time of year. I’m so pleasantly surprised by this perfume, I will definitely make it my next big fragrance purchase. A must try ladies!	positif
928	16683618	This is not a moisturizer for dry skin. It is very light. The positive is it leaves your hands feeling soft. It is not greasy once it soaks in. The best aspect of this lotion is the fragrance. It has major staying power! The scent is light but noticeable all day. My favorite is Sweet Tea. It smells so clean. Working at a hospital this lotion is a great alternative to perfume.	positif
929	5168338	I love this fragrance! It's smells AMAZING and I even think it smells better than the original daisy! It says that this perfume is supposed to be the same as the original but I don't think so. This one is sweeter by a long shot! Such a great scent and it's perfect for the holidays! I even think I'll buy another bottle just to have a back up!	positif
930	19636009	Smells soooo good! I’m not sure it’s the fragrance for me just yet (mixing with my natural pheromones and all) but it smells so good! This scent lasts long and seems to be about the same value as any high quality top brand perfume ?? So glad I’m apart of influenster so I can sample stuff like this!	positif
931	5206246	travel-friendly. All time favorite perfume, I'm a fragrance junkie, I LOVE perfume, but this is my everyday go to, perfect, ideal, scent!! I've been around this perfume my whole life, and every time I smell it, it just reminds me of my childhood! Beautiful staple for the rest of my life.	positif
932	6065532	reusable. This scent is beautiful. Funny story, a year or so ago I was at Nordstrom and came across this fragrance. I initially thought that the bottle was unique, and was just honestly intrigued. Upon the first spray, I hated it. I was overwhelmed with how strong it was. Later on, I didn't think much of it. All I can say is that the scent lingered on my body for quite some time but did I think about purchasing this product? No. Later on, as in just a few weeks ago (lol) I received a sample of this with another order. I smelled it again, and fell in love with it this time. It was weird, I couldn't even tell you what changed. Fast forward to yesterday, when I received my 1 oz in the mail. The packaging was beautiful, and I had my first ever Mugler perfume. I showered last night, and smelt the scent in my sleep throughout the night, literally. I woke up this morning, and the scent was still there. Got ready for work, applied vaseline on my wrists and alongside my neck. Now, I am DEEPLY in love with it. I made a Mugler account, and purchased the 3 oz, only because Sephora doesn't carry it. If you're on the fence about this, use it first. Let it sink into your skin. Let it settle in. I promise, you will love it.	positif
933	19077619	The fragrance reminds me a lot of the Angel perfume that Mugler makes. This smells a tad bit more floral, but it’s very close to Angel. It’s sweet and musky. Overall it’s a very classy scent. It’s not my particular preference as it’s a bit too sweet and musky, but it’s very nice.	positif
934	6251361	"This is a lovely fragrance, just perfect for summer! My boyfriend noticed I had changed my scent and commented that I smelt gorgeous! also the girls in the office kept saying ""what's that lovely smell"". It is a very floral and summery fragrance that's lasts all day, highly recommended will definitely be my perfume of choice from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"	positif
935	16777372	It's beautiful, but as I had massive allergic reactions to the perfumes used in the primer and foundation, I'll be returning this as I'm nervous about and not confident I can trust the line. If you have fragrance/chemical sensitivities, please be aware there is a scent to this product that is similar to the creme brulee smell used in the ABH highlighters.	positif
936	14306105	One of my favorite perfumes at the store. This scent goes on in the morning and lasts all day. It has a soft but still bold smell that lets everyone know you are good with your hygiene. There are always good sales around so I've never paid over 6 dollars for it. It is one of my main suggestions of their fragrances.	positif
937	922089	I love the smell of this perfume and its a long lasting scent	positif

940	7839607	I love this scent so much. I tend to gravitate toward smells that have a hint of a cologne scent to them and this perfume definitely does that. I love the lingering scent that it creates, i think this is the perfect scent for seduction!	positif

It's way to pricy but it's so good I have to buy it forever. I don't know if it's worth the price but it does last on my skin for awhile and it's such a sexy smell! I can't even fully describe the scent it's so different I just think of a bunch of different things that can't possibly mix together but they do! I love it. Amazing product. Thank you Jaclyn Hill for the review on this YouTube definitely made me buy it! Fragrance Type: Citrus/Fruity, Floral, Fresh/Aquatic Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend	positif
979	4871714	My number one reason to love this scent is it WORKS on me! Something with my skin does not react well with fragrances, they absolutely never last, even minutes later they are gone, except for Flowerbomb! It lasts until I wash it off! Another excellent thing about this perfume is it's universal appeal. I don't love flower scents, or vanilla scents, and while Flowerbomb has both, it does not straight up smell of flowers and vanilla. It's very powerful but in a smooth and creamy way. It has factors of tea and citrus and amber that make it stand apart from any other floral or vanilla scent.I also always get compliments that people love my perfume when I wear this! Even people that strongly dislike scents have told me they really like this one.I also think the bottle/packaging is great. It's beautiful and striking but not too delicate or tippy. The diamond grenade look of the bottle suits the scent inside because it is indeed explosive and elegant.	positif
980	5406157	This is my HG perfume, here is why:1. This scent smells different on everyone. When spraying it on the paper at Sephora, it was too patchouli, too strong, but on my skin it warms up to be more feminine, sweet, soft but still strong.2. Lasts forever on the skin and has a great throw, so you'll be smelling amazing to all for hours!3. This scent has enough warmth to be a perfect winter scent, but has a light sweetness for summer, a perfect year round fragrance!4. Bonus! I bought this when I first met my husband, our first summer of love, so I'm a bit biased!5. Packaging: No, you don't get a ton of fragrance for your buck, but come on, that packaging, that grenade, that beautiful pink fluid is to die for!Overall I can't live without this fragrance! Highly recommend!	positif
981	24962889	Chloe love story comes elegantly presented in a simple white box with gold lettering. The perfume bottle itself is also simple and classically designed and would look great on any dressing table. My first impression of Chloe love story is fresh and floral. I initially smelt the scent of orange reminding me of warm sunny days with the aroma of fresh citrus. I liked the clean, simple smell of this fragrance which I would recommend for day or night wear. The only downside to Chloe love story is that after wearing all day at work the smell definitely faded. However this would not put me of purchasing. My boyfriend has become addicted to this scent.....and he's hard to please!! I have received so many comments on this fragrance however not many people seemed to be familiar with the scent.. Definitely a very special fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
982	4802064	high-quality, feminine, subtle. When I found out I'd be receiving Ralph Lauren Tender Romance to test out, I was skeptical in how good it would smell, since I never smelled a Ralph Lauren fragrance that I particularly fell in love with before. But as soon as I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised. It's a fantastic scent! I love subtly sweet, feminine fragrances, and this one fits the bill. I'm also very picky when it comes to perfume, so I give it a few days of wearing it before I determine whether it's worth buying a bigger size. Tender Romance is one perfume that I will definitely be purchasing in full sizes! It's such a clean, beautiful scent - so glad I was introduced to this one. Highly recommend it to anyone who prefers a classy scent as their signature fragrance. **I received this perfume complimentary fragrance for testing purposes, which had absolutely no impact on the outcome of my review.**	positif
983	561548	u201cYu201d from Yves Saint Laurent is undoubtably a win for the brand. Iu2019ll never say that Iu2019m a fragrance expert. I will say that I know what smells good no matter if itu2019s menu2019s cologne or womenu2019s perfume. My nose can always detect an immaculate scent with almost perfect accuracy. Now in regards to u201cYu201d. I must say that it will soon be a part of my weekly rotation. Itu2019s a scent like no other, literally. I tried to think of something to compare it to but just couldnu2019t do it. It feels like they really took their time to get this one right. I wore the scent to work and was given compliments by people Iu2019ve never spoken to before. Is this the 1st u201csocial scentu201d? Lol, jk. But, if I see YSL using that term in their marketing Iu2019ll be very upset. The sage and ginger notes really stick out to me when I put it on. A really great blend.

984	10555515	"This scent is to die for! I'm a huge creature of habit but was feeling spontaneous one day when shopping for a new perfume. This was one of the first i tried and I immediately fell in love! it's a bit pricey but i totally feel it's worth it YSL always has great gift sets available that will make it well worth the money spent, especially when you're taking home extra goodies for a the same price as a single bottle! Also the scent of this fragrance is so rich and yummy you only need a couple sprays to last throughout the day, even for me it manages to stick to me all day despite the dirty NYC air. lol :) my number scent!...P.S. I got my nails done on Saturday and only had a couple sprays left in my bottle and a woman asked, ""what are you wearing you smell delicious!!' yup, definitely repurchasing!"	positif
985	24914505	They say you’re supposed to change your “signature scent” every ten years. So what I wanted was a grown up version of what I was already using. Even though I still do occasionally reach for my juicy couture, I do love this scent. My favorite time to use this perfume is when I’m doing something particularly unglamorous like grocery shopping or doing dishes. It kind of smells like berries and peonies, which makes me feel glamorous. I love the packaging it came with because I love the color combination of purple and black. This is a good fragrance for really feminine people, my husband really likes when I wear this too. Actually, most people around me do complement me! I think this is a universally nice smelling scent to everyone.The formula itself is very long lasting and despite the perfume not being clear it does not stain clothes.	positif
986	4730669	Once in a blue moon a scent dances across our olfactory that sends one into a frenzy. For me, Lipstick On has completely transported me into another dimension. The first time I was in-store to try it, I will admit the first initial spritz (at least to me) was quite displeasing, like I few others have mentioned smells just like old lipstick, but as I continued on with my shopping and walking around the mall and even having supper, the longer it permeated the more entranced I became. The scent made me feel so feminine, confident and sexy, that I knew it had to be mine. As I left the shopping center that evening I was regretting not purchasing, so much so that I doubled back to the mall to get it (was halfway home, and live twenty-some miles from this location, and of course since it's a nicer area it was the only Sephora location that carries these fragrances in store). That very evening I have started gifting away my other 14 full size bottles of perfume to family and friends. I have a new signature scent and I hope this fragrance is around for a good long while.	positif
987	10552520	This is a sweet floral. Like the candy sweetness is the first thing that hits you and surprises you as it initially overwhelms the floral. After awhile it meshes with the floral more and then I would say it is the floral more that lingers. It is a pleasant appealing smelling fragrance. Not the kind to give you a headache despite being a floral which is a bit rare. Definitely a young, feminine, and elegant scent. The sweetness and touch of citrus keeps it a young floral scent rather than an old lady floral scent. Like I could imagine this on a young chic woman. I would say this one is an all occasion perfume and is suitable for all seasons. It can be a bit too floral (like a simple blooming bouquet), but if you want a straight up floral without any spice, vanilla, or musk mixed in, then this would be it. It reminds me of a gentler Coco Mademoiselle.	positif
988	5125803	This is the scent that I have been searching for and now it has been created. I don't think that I have words to describe how much I love this new Chanel fragrance. It feels like Chanel . 5's cool and breezy niece. There is a hint of . 5, but so much more. Chanel . 5 is a classic and still sexy fragrance that I apply for special occasions, but I wanted a fresh, clean, lighter everyday scent. I have found it in the new l'eau. (I have the original true . 5 perfume.) I went to the mall expecting to purchase another brand that I thought I liked, but my husband didn't care for it. After thinking about, it did smell too powdery. I then tried the l'eau and it was instant love! This is not a heavy, intoxicating fragrance, so if you are looking for that type, this isn't the one. It almost seems like a spring/summer scent with citrus, ocean, cedar, and light musk. It's so well balanced, interesting, and just gorgeous! He bought it for me for Christmas. It's hard to wait to open it!	positif
989	25328245	TL;DR: Extremely Light Timeless Scent I smelled this in-store when it first launched and I had forgotten the scent when I bought it recently. Glad I made the purchase because it is an elegant light floral fragrance which can be worn any time of the year and for any occasion. Although it’s an eau de parfum, it’s lighter than any eau de toilette I’ve ever come across. On that thought, it kind of acts like an eau de toilette; almost undetectable by the end of the day. There is a top note that you can smell on paper and goes away when on skin. I think this has the potential to be someone’s signature scent. To be frank, this is what I imagined rich people to smell like. lol Unassuming, chic, timeless. If I ever finish this bottle (because I’ve never been able to finish a perfume yet), I’ll definitely repurchase. I think this fragrance is a good one to start out with for new perfume-wearers/beginners.	positif
990	5241668	Being from LA originally, I had to try this fragrance out. I bought the travel size version and am now looking to get the full size. When I first tried it, I was worried that it smelled too similar to a favorite fragrance of mine, Versace's Yellow Diamond. Both have distinct citrus notes, but after comparing the two more carefully, YD is much lighter and more feminine (and its citrusiness is much more prominent) whereas this fragrance is more complex and has a much earthier scent courtesy of the juniper (reminds me of smells of the Southwestern desert). I can understand why other reviewers think this scent doesn't last long, because I can't smell it on myself after an hour or two. However, I know for a fact that the scent lingers the whole day on me because other people will comment on it when they're near me and tell me how wonderful it smells. I've found that if you're able to smell your own perfume the whole day, it usually means you're wearing too much. If you're looking for a unique and lively fragrance, try this one out. It's quickly becoming a top favorite of mine.	positif
991	24556056	I was on the hunt for a simple multi use soap that would simplify my routine and leave my skin comfortable, because while I enjoy my usual multi product regimen- somedays I just ain’t got time for that.The Dove Pink Bar far exceeds my expectations. Creamy lather, soft skin that isn’t tight feeling after. The scent is pretty, though I think it’s just broaching the side of too sweet and cloying, but happily it doesn’t cross the line. The scent itself reminds me of a clean rose water! Mmmmm smells sooo good! But after rinsing I don’t smell of it, which is good for me, I don’t have to worry about it affecting any perfumes I wear or when I go without fragrances irritating anyone who is scent sensitive.My face feels great and is completely makeup free after washing. My hands are less dry feeling as well.It’s classic for a reason, and both performance and price make it a great value. I’m happy to highly recommend it!	positif
992	5840959	Smells exactly like it sounds. Pure Beach. Amazing. Doesn't have the longest staying power but does cling to clothes and hair better than it does skin, oddly enough. So far as staying power goes - you sort of want it to fade a bit anyhow as it's not the type of scent you want to carry on full force all day but I do wish it lingered just a bit more strongly. In fairness it is the type of scent you may stop noticing yourself but other people will still catch the fragrance notes on you in passing. Sure you could use a primer but why would you want to have to buy that too when you're coughing up $145 for perfume? That seems a tad redundant and an unnecessary exercise in luxurious futility that is not practical for most. Get a sample or two from Sephora and wear it for a day or two and see if you are happy with the longevity if you're concerned but overall the scent is heavenly. Sits happily on my shelf next to Fantasies Flying and the two actually don't smell bad together either.	positif
993	17965111	This is the best smelling cologne/perfume/fragrance in the entire world. It smells exactly like the flowers on a real orange tree. It is very lightly sweet, heavily intoxicating, floral but not over powering, and a little citrusy. This is definitely not one of those sickeningly sweet, candy type fragrances. I hate super sweet candy type fragrances, they smell like garbage to me. This scent is definitely not garbage. This fragrance is meant more for a woman; a lady like, feminine, sophisticated woman, not meant for a girl. This is a timeless scent that can be used during any season of the year. I have the large bottle, which is kind of expensive but worth every penny, that has lasted me over 3 years now and only a quarter of it has been used. This is not one of those perfumes that should be sprayed 20 times (excessive) to get the smell to stick, 2 spritzes is more than enough to last the entire day. I also love that jo malone fragrances can be mixed to form a custom scent, really love the uniqueness and individuality of that.	positif
994	15673355	I wish I could give 100 stars! I first smelled Jo Malone Nectarine Blossom and Honey on a customer of mine. I had to stop what I was doing and ask what she was wearing. When she told me, I had never yet heard of Jo Malone fragrances. Bless her heart, she pulled out one of the little 9ml bottles and told me to keep it! That was enough to make me a customer! Thank you, my customer! This perfume has a distinct scent. I can literally pick it up off of anyone who may be wearing it. That is how much of an impact it made on me! It is a great summer scent! It is light, yet alive. It is fruity, yet sexy. It is feminine, fresh and just so very perfect. Jo Malone fragrances are a bit expensive. They are worth it, though. The scent lasts all day long. I actually smell it just as strong on my clothing the next time I pick it up. You don't need to use a whole lot. Try Nectarine Blossom and Honey before any other Jo Malone fragrance. Just make sure you get the real deal and not a knock off! Jo Malone Nectarine Blossom and HoneyJo Malone Nectarine Blossom and Honey	positif
995	4756673	This fragrance is a complex floral that has something mysterious about it. At first, the white flower bouquet smells romantic and lovely but after several hours heavier notes come forward, like patchouli. This is definitely a woman's fragrance and is not a sweet and fruity teen scent. It's also not a matronly scent but something altogether different and unique. It's destined to be a classic. It's a seasonless fragrance that is light enough for the warmer months yet strong enough for the cooler ones. Every time I wear it, I get compliments from both women and men and everyone wants to know what I'm wearing. But it's my little secret, lol! This fragrance is very alluring and sexy and yet is also quite playful. It's almost two entirely different scents and I love that about it. I also love that it doesn't have any vanilla in it (vanilla is for eating not for a perfume, yuck!). I also detect some slight masculine notes, when the perfume reaches its dry down phase. This is a lovely scent to add to any collection. The french make the most wonderful perfumes and this one is no exception. I highly recommend it.	positif
996	5023842	good value, long lasting, smells pretty, alluring. I was looking for a new fragrance and couldn't find one that I could commit to... so naturally I gravitated to the Sephora Deluxe Perfume Sampler (ITEM 1775162) which is now Out of Stock online but I was able to get in store! I wanted to get a grown up, warm scent. (Think Gucci Guilty, but since everyone and my mama has that I needed something new) I was trying to avoid florals but after wearing this I fell in love with how it worked with my body chemistry. I didn't have trouble with the scent fading, in fact, it's quite powerful on me! Long lasting for sure. The 1oz will last me a long time. I was really torn between this and Gucci Bamboo. But I'm glad I got this in a (small) full size. If you loved Ralph Lauren Romance... this is a nice upgrade to it. :) My husband loves this scent on me. This might be my new go to!	positif
997	25554912	Alien is my signature scent. It is pretty & mysterious at the same time; it is sweet, soft and woody all at the same time and in perfect balance;  It lasts really well on my skin, and sometimes I can even still smell it on the second day before I take a shower. It has such an alluring and curious scent it's like nothing I've ever smelt before. I've had many perfumes before and in all the years I've been buying my own beauty products I've never found a scent I've literally had to have. This fragrance makes me feel unique,  powerful and mysterious every time I wear it.I do love the packaging as well, the bottle is super cool and unique, and the purple color is so pretty (I have it displayd on my vanity). 	positif
998	6256345	"From first glance I found the packaging to be cute and feminine and reflected the scent really well. I loved the addition of the embroidered alligator on the perfume bottle. The smell stays wonderfully consistent and I found that the frangrances intensity didn't falter throughout the day. The scent was pleasant and fruity and many friends, family, and even my boyfriend said I smelled great and wanted to know what perfume it was. Although the packaging was nice I felt that the bottle style didn't quite sell te understated beauty of the fragrance. Although I recognise that the bottle style is brand linked, I feel as though people will associate it with being a more ""sport central"" scent due to the masculine structure of the bottle. I feel like by the bottle appearing more feminine and soft could really benefit the brand and could further their audience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"	positif
999	15302057	So ever since I got the campaign I've been counting down the days until this perfume arrived. I'd mentioned i was a bzzagent to a few friends and told them about my first campaign and was told they had this perfume and adore it. So with a knock at the door the wait was over...i unpacked the box and my first thought was that the bottle design is amazing and elegant and if nothing else it's going to look fantastic on my dressing table. Like a mini classic handbag. I spritzed the scent all over myself so I could review the product fully. Citrus fresh was my first thought....this then changed to a strong deeper floral scent. After wearing for about 2 hours the scent changed again to a warmer rich sultry smell. I usually go for lighter sweeter smells and at first i didnt think this would be a fragrance i would use again but as the hours past by I can see myself using this on an evening when i want to feel sexy and sophisticated.

1000	13057703	"If I had to wear one scent for the rest of my life it would be this one. The first time I smelled it was in high school while working in the box office at a movie theater. This girl came in and the wind from the air lock blew the scent toward me and I had to stop her and ask what she was wearing. This is extremely rare for me as I have a serious physical reaction to most scents, particularly perfumes. I get sick to my stomach, a horrible head ache, and very dizzy. But this body spray has never given me any problems. It smells so delicious and lasts forever on my body. I also get the most compliments when I were it over the other 4 scents I can actually wear. It is technically a ""retired"" scent at B&BW, though is still available, and I'm terrified it's going to go away. But it is my favorite.

1001	5006428	absorbs quickly, rich, moisturizing, smooth. Guys. I don't play when it comes to moisturizing my body. For the past couple of years I've gone the more traditional route, mixing my own concoction of shea and cocoa butter or using fractioned coconut oil. That keeps me moisturized but it also leaves me feeling greasy. That's why I'm glad I got a sample of this with (what feels like) my weekly Sephora order. I was worried about the scent from all the reviews, as I'm very sensitive to scents. I didn't notice any scent. It smells just kind of like...lotion. I wear perfume daily and the scent of this does not compete with my fragrance. This body butter absorbs quickly but doesn't leave your skin feeling like you need to reapply it every hour. My skin feels smooth and supple for a good 6 hours. I really like it. The only drawback is that I have to use a good bit of it so this would get a bit expensive having to replace it every month.	positif
1002	5107350	good value, long lasting for cost. This is a beautiful scent, after trying it in the store I became immediately obsessed with it and bought the full sized bottle. I would describe it as a sexy forest-y woodsy slightly floral fragrance, the dry down is gorgeous and with the subtle vetiver, it's super seductive. It lasts so long I can smell it on me even after showering! My only issue is the packaging, it wouldn't be the most travel friendly and the lid is clunky but it's adorable that it's designed to look like a clutch, if you're into packaging. I would buy an atomizer and not travel with this. This is honestly the best perfume I've smelt in a long time (my usual go-to scent is Atelier Cologne's Figuer Ardent, if you're into something like that, this is a good scent for you!)	positif
1003	15301061	I'm so in love with this new fragrance. It’s on my Christmas list and my sister too! This scent reminds me of my younger years as my Mum would wear CK Obsession all the time. These were great times and every time I smell it on my skin (it lasts all day!) it reminds me of her and many fond memories of my childhood. If you like a musky, woody scent this is perfume is for you. The top notes are citrusy and with base notes of musk, this makes it the perfect woody scent and another classic from Calvin Klein. Whilst paying from my shopping the checkout assistant commented on how nice my perfume was, at this point I have been wearing it from approximately 6hours so this is definitely worth the money, then later that same day my sister asked if I have been to visit our mum as she could smell her on me. The re-design of the packaging & bottle makes it look fresh but still in keeping with classic Obsession design. A great remake of an old classic!

1004	6248160	Firstly, I really like the packaging - the box almost feels like velvet and it looks quite classy. Upon opening the box, I saw that the product looks quite small inside, perhaps a little bit of a waste in terms of packaging? I think the bottle is cute and I really like the handbag design. I found the lid didn't quite fit flush to the bottle but that's hardly an issue for me. When I first sprayed the perfume, I was surprised at how sweet it smelled - almost a candy type of smell - on the box it describes it as having a fairly woody scent. After a moment or two, some of the sweetness evaporated and it was indeed more of a woody fragrance. I think the scent of the perfume is really pleasant and my other half commented on how nice he thought it was. Before I got the product, I did wonder how long the scent would last and I discovered that it is very long lasting, hours later and I can still smell it - result! It's not my absolute favourite perfume in the world but I do like it very much and would possibly buy this again, either for myself or as a gift.

1005	5848214	Mon Guerlain is the ultimate natural beauty of a fragrance for me. I got a sample of this and knew right away I needed the biggest bottle available. I love all the notes in this fragrance and even though they are simple, the way they all blend together is so beautiful. At first I get the freshness of the Lavender, of course the Vanilla and the Sandalwood and Jasmine give it a perfect base. Lavender doesn't show up often in women's perfume, but I love it so much. It's the best scent for transporting me to lush wild fields full of wildflowersin Provence. Blended with Vanilla alone it's a super-calming aroma. With the added sensuality of the Sandalwood and romantic Jasmine, it creates a scent that is soothing, sensual, romantic and ultimately elegant. It almost comes together as a honey-like or brown sugar fragrance about mid-way through wearing it. I find that it's a moderate strength that is neither super light or loud. There seem to be many negative reviews complaining about the use of Angelina Jolie as the model for the scent. I'm not her biggest fan, but I honestly don't care who the model is - if I like the scent it doesn't matter. Lots of people are also saying this is just another generic, pink, gourmand, sickly sweet smell - but I don't agree at all. Sure it has a strong vanilla, but it's not sugary or 'candy' like, unless you immediately associate vanilla with candy. It's an elegant vanilla, made calmer and more grounded by the other notes. Theirry Wasser who was the main perfumer on this scent, also did Dior Addict - which is also a top-five favorite of mine. The bottle used for this perfume is utterly gorgeous - it looks gorgeous on my table and is the kind of thing you'd keep for decor long after using the perfume just because it's beautiful. Nothing negative to say here, I think this will be a favorite for years to come.	positif
1006	5848215	calming, romantic, elegant, high quality. Mon Guerlain is the ultimate natural beauty of a fragrance for me. I got a sample of this and knew right away I needed the biggest bottle available. I love all the notes in this fragrance and even though they are simple, the way they all blend together is so beautiful. At first I get the freshness of the Lavender, of course the Vanilla and the Sandalwood and Jasmine give it a perfect base. Lavender doesn't show up often in women's perfume, but I love it so much. It's the best scent for transporting me to lush wild fields full of wildflowers - like being in Provence smelling the fresh Lavender buds. Blended with Vanilla alone it's a super-calming aroma. With the added sensuality of the Sandalwood and romantic Jasmine, it creates a scent that is soothing, sensual, romantic and ultimately elegant. It almost comes together as a honey-like or brown sugar fragrance about mid-way through wearing it. I find that it has a moderate strength that is neither super light or loud.

1007	7817014	Let me start by saying that I am huge Chanel fan. I absolutely adore their brand and have not encountered a perfume by this house that I dislike. It is no surprise that I am among the legions of Coco Mademoiselle lovers. Coco Mademoiselle is different from the older Chanel scents such as No.5 and Coco. I can see that this is aimed to please the modern fashionistas. That in itself gets Coco Mademoiselle some bad critic from more experienced perfumers who generally seem to shun modern mainstream trends, but personally I think the addition of Coco Mademoiselle was a good move from Chanel. By vying for a younger, modern market it ensures the continuous survival of the house. Coco Mademoiselle opens sharp and citrusy, I can specifically smell the grapefruit which gives it an interesting twist. The middle notes soon appear and the entire fragrance is so smoothly blended that it is hard to pick out individual notes. The scent turns fruity and sweeter which must be from the litchi. Rose sort of lifts this scent above a plain fruity scent yet I wouldn't call this a fruity floral. It is unique and elegant, refreshing and beautiful. The citrus tartness never fully disappears, which makes this a sparkly, lively and bright scent. Patchouli deepens the base and a hint of vetiver adds a beautiful spicey earthiness to this scent. Coco Mademoiselle is such a beloved perfume for a reason. It is good quality, the silage is good and it lasts an easy 10 hours or more on my skin. I prefer this bright refreshing perfume in summer or spring, but it is not at all unpleasant during cold weather. Every time I catch a whiff of this it instantly lifts my spirits. The bottle is absolutely gorgeous too, which just adds to this little olfactory pleasure. ?	positif
1008	24962860	This is a perfume that lasting power definitely isn't a problem for.. I found the scent boasts a lovely and strong floral essence infused with a slight musky finish, a scent which I could still smell tones of the following morning. Given the romantic but fresh aroma of this fragrance, I believe its diverseness makes it a suitable contender to be used as an all round perfume, suiting both day and evening. A sure factor which I believe other consumers, like myself, would be thrilled to hear prior to purchasing. The golden, glass bottle is both classy and elegant with a finishing structure which seems to resembles that of a padlock. Love Story is also packaged in a simple but on theme white box with gold detailing and a small note explaining the flip feature (this being the bend of the golden semi-circle adjoined to the bottle) which allows you to remove the lid. If I could make any improvements to this product it would be to do with the aesthetics only and not the actual scent. My first being that I pondered whether the ribbon featured on the bottle could be attached in a slight more appealing manner, this is currently knotted around the golden half circle previously mentioned. I also wasn't a massive fan of the plastic lid, this felt slightly cheap compared to the rest of the image projected by the bottle and scent. I also found it a little difficult to remove at times. However, these are just personal preferences and observations, definitely not issues that would prevent or deter me from repurchasing the item again in the future. Overall, I found Love Story by Chloé to be a very fresh and sexy scent that I imagine could serve a vast audience of users, leaving them, like myself, rather pleased with this unique addition and smelling completely lovely.

1009	4737885	I have always been a scent-aholic since I was young. I have loved many different fragrances. Non quite the way I love this.I was honestly concerned from some of the reviews of this product... Grandma smell? Maybe if your grandma was young, smoldering, and her milkshake brought all the boys to the yard!The details: even at first spray I found it intoxicating. Not the weird overbearing scent some have described. When I went in and tested I was immediately hooked. I had the associate set the bottle behind the counter as I finished my Seohora shopping experience.I sprayed it on myself around 11 a.m. It is now 4 p.m. I only spritzed one tiny squirt onto my wrist, dabbing onto the other while dabbing onto my neck. I smelled the spice, the floral, the dark undertones immediately with that hint of amber... Which has now become more prominent as it has settled. Less spice, but still noticeable with a nice dose of amber.I find nothing old about this selection. I find it bold, sexy, and I keep wanting to sniff my wrists.. It's becoming an issue.I am a career woman in very early 30's and this scent feels mature, powerful, and above all else like a fox. I was turning heads out of the mall and the car ride home with the heat vents blowing continued to waft the scent through the air. It was like heaven.I would never tell anyone to go buy a perfume based on my experience alone. We all have different scent profiles and our chemistry adheres to certain notes. Be sure you try this on your wrist at the store before deciding. Start with the spritz and continue to shop so you can get more of the profile.It may be considered a bit pricey to some, but I think it's just right.. Especially considering the bottle is refillable and the refills will not cost as much as the initial purchase. This is also not a scent you should over indulge on- too much I feel would be enough to put people off. Therefore, a bottle of this will get you much farther than lesser cost fragrances that don't have this staying power.My advice? If you like fresh light teeny bop happy airy fragrances, this probably won't be your favorite thing. 16 year old me was a Clinique Happy girl all the way.. I would like to think I graduated to a more mature scent profile ;)	positif
1010	12112394	This is perfect for a travel size palette, and it was my first tarte purchase, it gives you a good taste of both the matte and shimmer shades, light and dark, plus the formula that is in the bigger tartelette palettes without such a large investment as the full sized palettes, $21 for the tartelette tease compared to $45 for the tartelette & tartelette in bloom (and it smells like a yummy buttercream on top of everything else)	positif
1011	11609591	This is seriously the best lip mask EVER! I had a terrible dry spot on my bottom lip and after using this one time it went away almost completely! It smells great and has a good taste (I know you don't eat it, but that's important in case it gets in your mouth!). I've received compliments on my lips after using this saying they look plump and just overall look great! This is definitely worth the price and a holy grail product. I take it every where with me!	positif
1012	5410756	"I feel like the old Herbal Essence shampoo commercial when I spray this..""Yesss..Yessssss!! YESSSSSSSS!!!!!"" This is just..as another reviewer put it..this is a masterpiece. This immediately reminds me of a fragrance from many years (perhaps even decades, showing my age!!) past..and dang if I can remember the name..I did peek on fragrantica, thinking it might be there under 'this reminds me of..."" , but that fragrance is not listed there. However, in today's world of overly sweet and/or heavy on the florals, this is a nice change. Feels classy, sophisticated, womanly, not girly. I don't know why or how, but to me, it seems the fragrance industry leans towards the young gals with the overly sweet and fruity scents. So many fragrances out there 'these days' seem so cloying and so many smell like the last one. This to me is an 'original'. This, to me, has a definite classy feel and scent about it, but is also a clean type of scent. Not heavy at all, which my sensitive nose appreciates, and besides, I just do not like wearing anything heavy because I know others may not appreciate it (allergies, etc). This also has a very slight sexy scent about it. And somewhat of a comforting scent about it. Classy, clean, sexy, comforting, all rolled into one fragrance..? Sign me up!! Again...this is a masterpiece. My initial thought is this is a great Fall/Winter scent, but I also think this would be nice in the Summer for an evening out. Really though, as with any fragrance any more, this could be worn any time of year, day or night. It is not so light that is screams 'daytime' yet it is not heavy to merit a definite night out scent. Very much a masterpiece. The bottle is very basic, no frills, but I think the bottle is a great representation of the fragrance itself. Classy, classic, timeless. After 3 failed 'blind buys' (when will I learn..?!?), this was a very successful 'blind buy'. Where I live the department stores are all very small and the larger ones are over an hour away, so I do not have the luxury of just hopping over to a mall or outlet to sniff away at the perfume/fragrance counter when the mood strikes. LOL. I was hoping this came in EDP, and I am sure it does, but for an EDT (I did not want to plunk down a large sum of cash for this after 3 failed blind buys), the staying power is pretty impressive. Will definitely repurchase and definitely look into the EDP version of this!! I would, however, not suggest doing a 'blind buy' with this. Fragrance is so subjective and body chemistry plays a big part in how fragrances smell and also which notes a person picks up versus another person. So I would suggest testing this out if you are thinking about buying this, as with any fragrance."	positif
1013	18665459	I received this body lotion as a Christmas gift, along with several other lotions. This one came from Bath & Body Works, which is a specialty store that sells bath and body products as well as candles and other products. These products can be on the pricey side, but they are always running special deals and always have coupons so you can get a discount on their products. I always love getting products from Bath & Body Works as gifts, and occasionally I will splurge on something for myself. The reason I love their lotions is because they are highly scented, and the fragrance lasts quite a long time compared to other lotions on the market.This particular scent, Japanese Cherry Blossom, is one of the most popular, and for good reason. The scent is very pleasant, a bit floral, yet exotic and rich. I use this lotion in conjunction with the body wash (which also smells amazing) and the scent lingers all day. I have a bottle of this lotion on my desk as well, so I can apply it to my hands throughout the day for extra moisturizing and a pleasant scent. Almost every time I apply it, I get asked by co-workers what that lovely smell is.I usually apply lotion all over my body after a shower. This lotion is good at moisturizing, although not the very best. It seems that the best moisturizers seem to be the ones that have no scent or that smell bad. If my skin is particularly dry and I am in need of additional moisture, I will apply an unscented thicker cream first and then follow up with this lotion. I only use this lotion on my body, never my face. Because of the high perfume level, I am afraid it would cause my skin to react. Plus, it is not designed to be used on the face, just the body. For areas that need extra help, like heels and elbows, this lotion isn’t sufficient. But for everyday moisturizing, it’s fine. I primarily use it for the scent.The bottle I receives was 8oz, a nice size that you can even put into your purse if you want to take it with you. The packaging is very pretty with shiny reds and pale pink flowers. This lotion truly feels like an indulgence, although it’s not super expensive. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who wants to moisturize and smell great at the same time. When paired with the body wash, it will leave you skin feeling and smelling great for hours! This product also makes a great gift for birthdays or other holidays, and is available in gift baskets as well.	positif
1014	4761138	I have been super allergic to fragrances ever since I had my children twenty years ago! I would get headaches and nauseated if I smelled any perfume (except maybe citrus scents). I was so bummed about this. Then came Flowerbomb. I definitely could not do floral scents at all. The moment I smelled this perfume, I fell in love. I mean, you got me at the first spray!! For me, it smells powdery, a bit like vanilla, and floral. It is so hard to describe this unique scent other than just saying it is fabulous! Buy it! If you are questioning buying it - get the rollerball. I do this when trying out new scents. The staying power is not the best with this perfume. The only bummer about it so I keep a rollerball in my purse. My favorite way to wear this to last longer? Spray it on my hairbrush and brush it through my hair. Doesn't dry out my hair and the scent lasts all day!!! Seriously my signature scent for life and I am a 50 years old make up artist and lover of all things beauty! I love it so much I have to put a little of the body cream on my wrists just so I can smell it while drifting off to sleep. No headaches! Yahoo - it's a winner!	positif
1015	5938346	epic, spot on, beachy, surfer girl approved, must-have, needs to be permanent!. For me, this is the absolutely perfect beach scent. As someone who actually spends a ton of time on the beach, in the water and sand, surfing and paddleboarding, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the most accurate beach scent I've ever found. It captures not only the way your skin smells in the sun, but also the light wisp of fresh flowers in the air from lush seaside greenery. It's not heavily floral and it doesn't reek of sunscreen in the way that other beachy scents by Tom Ford and Replica do. It's less floral and more salty than my Kai, but I look forward to layering the two. This is not a heavy fragrance that people are going to smell on you in the nightclub. It's a legit laid back fragrance that truly captures the vibe of an outdoorsy lifestyle by the water. This makes sense, as Wende Zomnir of Urban Decay is a surfer. Incidentally, the perfumer who designed this, Sarah Horowitz, is legit. Some of her other scents are cult faves (like Perfect Veil) in the niche perfume market, known for being clean and simple, and this is her first truly beach inspired scent (that I know of). It's actually phenomenal to be able to have one of her fragrances for only $25, and the fact that you can buy this anywhere Urban Decay is sold is an added bonus. I'm going to be stocking up.	positif
1016	5408366	Wow, I'm so happy that this magical elixir completely melds with my body chemistry!I'm starting to really get into the oriental spicy category of fragrance, and I recently bought Obsession. That worked beautifully on me. I'd heard a lot about Youth Dew, and I've read tons of polarizing reviews. So I went on Ebay and blind-bought a bottle of Youth Dew just for the sake of trying it.Upon first spray, it's very aldehydic. That scared me. Then these beautiful, warm, spicy notes took my fear away. I mean, wow! This is my kind of scent. I'd read so many reviews claiming that it stunk, and that it only works on certain people with the right chemistry. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones. I'll also add that I only put one spritz on my neck. It's very strong. I read that the EDP contains 30% perfume oil, that's why the liquid is so dark. The color of the juice is exactly how it smells: dark, mysterious, powerful, and sexual. Definitely a femme fatale scent.I would recommend sampling before buying. And don't let the top notes scare you off. This is a late autumn/winter scent. I'm 26, and I love this stuff. So it's not about age, it's about your taste and body chemistry.My only regret is not buying this potion sooner!	positif
1017	4733627	good value. My first memory of Aromatics Elixir would be around 1979- i was 15 and me and my bestfriend used to stalk every counter in the cosmetics counter at Belks.It is a vivid memory not only because of the scent,but the bottle was displayed very simply on a clear shelf which was placed on the counter with no other products around-notable because every single other counter was jam packed with dozens of tester bottles and makeup displays, I was drawn to the darkly spicy effervescent scent. But I already realized even before that -that I wasn't a Loves Baby Soft kind of girl. Another scent that echoed that sentiment was Calyx-zesty,energizing and memorable. I do believe there are old lady perfumes,everything AVON sells in their fragrance line smells like my grandma smelled when she was alive,But Aromatics is far from being old lady like:.I could easily see David Bowie wrapped in this -It's peculiar,its evokes dark snowy nights and reminds me ot the tobacco my grandfather would have in his pipe, I just really don't like flowery,fruity or sweet-one of my favorite fragrances of all is Fahrenite by Chrstian Dior and Chanel Coco Mademoiselle is also on my wish list,I kind of think Aromatics Elixir is like an exclusive club,and I am glad to in that club-	positif
1018	5400601	"I have some perfumes, one for every day mood or season, but....I think this one is my signature scent. A girl told me I was wearing an aftershave perfume. I bet she was just envy and ignorant about perfumes, wearing some drugstore, cheap perfumes and judging my Chanel. This perfume is class in a bottle. It opens citrusy, maybe a little too strong for some noses, but if you wait for 10 minutes it turns into a mysterious and feminine fragrance that will make you fall in love with...citrusy notes leave a little (a lovely bergamot, that comes from Calabria, like me!!) to say welcome to a sweet bouquet of roses, narcissus and jasmine that stays on of me for a long time. But my favourite ""season"" of this scent comes after all of that...base notes of this scent are so relaxing....balsamic and a little soapy...patchouli, vanilla and some others...on me it has a pretty long longevity and a moderate/heavy sillage (it depends on how much you spray on) The bottle design is just wow. The most beautiful one I ever seen. Classy and evergreen. Price is the only sad thing about this lovely creature...Let me leave you all an advice: don't test it on a shop...ask for a little sample of this and smell it at home with no other perfumes in the air, ready to make you stoned and confused."	positif
1019	18517769	My first and all time favorite from Chanel has always been Coco. Yes I have #5 too but it has always taken a back burner to Coco. Now enters Gabrielle. I just had to have the large bottle! I got a generous sample and used it sparingly until I could buy a bottle. Chanel did put the price up there for this perfume but it is so worth it for me. I do not understand all the negative reviews here on MUA but to each their own. I find this fragrance last a very long time on myself and when I told the sales Rep. about the reviews here and how so many say they cannot smell it after a couple of hours, she said that it last a really long time on herself too. I used the last of my sample last evening a few hours before bed and the beautiful scent is still lingering on my skin and clothes at 10:00 A.M. this morning. The notes are listed as exotic jasmine with the fruity green notes of ylang-ylang, while fresh and sparkling orange blossom shines through, offering a glimpse of Grasse tuberose. The ad goes on to say, before creating the House of CHANEL, Coco was Gabrielle. A rebel at heart, passionate and free. So I take this to mean that the lady Coco Chanel's real name was Gabrielle? This is a feminine scent that is very rich from the first spray to the dry down. The bottle is not that impressive to my style but rather pretty much like the other Chanel bottles like Coco and #5. The scent is what I just had to have in my collection, just so beautiful.	positif
1020	17611061	CHANEL No. 5 is more than just a perfume, it’s a way of life.<br /><br />Nothing says class, sophistication, and refined taste than this little glass bottle created over 90 years ago. Timeless in its beauty, its integrity, its Parisian style, and its uncompromised quality. After all these years, CHANEL No. 5 is not only still one of the best selling perfumes in the world, but it still represents everything complex, elegant, chic, and powerful of a woman with unwavering beauty and intelligence.<br /><br />Just like the classic CHANEL jacket, this fragrance is a symbol of a real woman; a woman who knows who she is, where she’s going, and exactly how to get there.<br /><br />Created in 1921, Coco Chanel wanted a fragrance that smelled like a woman! A scent, just like the complexities of a strong woman, that would be seen as a whole and not the sum of its parts. CHANEL No. 5 is a composition of notes where one cannot easily distinguish its individual ingredients, instead smelling a bouquet of intricate and elaborate notes that intermingle like a mosaic of scent.<br /><br />Not only is this perfume unique in its composition, but it was also one of the first fragrances to use synthetic notes called Aldehydes. This move should not be taken as a choice for lower quality, instead, synthetic notes are often used for their unique expressions and their subtle combined effects versus using strong notes of actual flowers and plants. Generally, Aldehydes, like in fragrances like CHANEL No. 5, give the fragrance that ambiguous floral-citrus-soapy scent.	positif
1021	22804332	This was my main winter perfume for years!! I still use it every fall and winter, but now I’ve thrown a few more into the rotation. This has a really warm, but really deep fragrance: vanilla, rum soaked peaches, Amber, musk, and a tiny bit floral. All I know is that this is everything to me and I highly recommend every single woman give this a try. It’s not at all an old lady smell...this is more of a sultry, sexy scent and it will get people’s attention. I get asked all the time what I’m wearing or get told that I smell amazing. The scent is strong, so it doesn’t take very much and the bottle will last for a long time. It’s near the $100 mark, but worth every penny! I got mine at a department store in a gift set with a matching lotion with the same scent. This lotion is just as special as the perfume, as it’s like massaging gold onto your skin. It leaves the most beautiful shimmer that stays all day long. Again, perfect for winter. I love to wear both with a big comfy sweater, beautiful leggings, and tall thigh high leather boots...it just seems to all fit together. My bottle has lasted 2 full winters and now I’m on my 3rd season, needing more! I will buy this again and imagine I’ll buy it forever. Got get some ladies or gel your significant other to buy it for you...you won’t be disappointed.	positif
1022	25761235	Give it a go I applied a spritz of this to the crook of my arm the other day in Sephora and to be honest I wasn’t impressed. It smelled 100% like sunscreen. That’s not an over dramatization either. It smells as if someone put sunscreen in a perfume bottle. I personally LOVE the smell of sunscreen. That and the smell of chlorine just feel like summer and the smell of it truly makes me happy. That being said I was not about to fork up luxury priced dollars for a drugstore like smell. Not to mention it doesn’t have spf so why not just buy sunscreen right? Wrong! First this lasted on my skin forever! I woke up the next morning and could still smell it. Faint for sure but considering I applied it around 2pm the day before... that in it self was impressive. Second: the longer it sat on my skin the more sophisticated it became. What first smelled like sunscreen had slowly tuned into a scent that literally made me FEEL happy. It’s hard to explain the scent but basically it smelled like the way home from the beach. When you’ve been in the water and sand and sun all day. When you sit in your car and head home after a beautiful day at the beach. You’re a little sleepy from the sun and playing in the ocean and over all you just feel happy and cozy. That’s what this scent turned into. After initially wanting nothing to do with it in the beginning, I’m happy to report that I absolutely need this fragrance and so do you!	positif
1023	1896975	Acqua di Parma ACQUA DI PARMA eau de cologne spray is the cologne my husband has used for the past 20 years. To me it is exquisite, restrained and elegant and for the past 18 years I've been merrily pinching some when he's not looking. He must have rumbled me because he presented me with this Magnolia Nobile from the same house. I was instantly hooked.It's quite difficult to review a scent (perfume/fragrance) as one's preference is so personal but also influenced by which perfume brands appeal to you. What I mean is, it's not just the smell that makes someone choose for instance Paco Rabanne's Lady Million as opposed to Calvin Klein's Eternity. So here's some info on the brand: Aqua di Parma is an Italian Company dating back to 1916 which attained cult status when it was adopted by the likes of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in the 1930s. Today it maintains its top draw status by remaining firmly exclusive as it is fiendishly difficult to buy on the high street and impossible at the airport. Bravo Amazon then for pitching in!As for the smell: what is Magnolia Nobile like? I'm no expert so can only describe what I, err, smell. I would say it is a mainly floral scent with rose and jasmine notes and musky undertones from the smoky sandalwood and bergamot. It's definitely a grown-up scent. I just love it and would give it 5*+ if I could.	positif
1024	6076715	Like a lot of the reviews here, I received this as a generous trial gift of a 5ml bottle for reviewing along with its counter-part Saint. Although not something I'd probably pick out on my own (the goth styling of the bottle/package isn't my typical taste), Im always interested in fragrance and glad to try it and be able to review it. I will say this is my preferred fragrance of the two. I want to give my impression of the scent before I read the actual notes and description (more reliable without being influenced by what you are supposed to be smelling) Initially it is a lot more complex and interesting than Saint though they both share a similar base scent (sweet vanilla) but a more obvious/interesting balance that smells smoky - in a very nice way - and maybe a teensy hint of spice. Definitely could see why it would match a perfume name like this - it smells like the type of scent you would imagine a good girl with a wild edge wanting to wear. The vanilla is sometimes a little heavier/sweeter than I'd prefer on a daily basis, but this would make a lovely date night type of fragrance - girly and sweet and young..but with a little something extra. Reading the actual description now, I have to say I don't smell any of the fruity notes listed. Not really cinnamon or woodsy either, though Im glad I was right that this is basically 'Saint' with an added layer.	positif
1025	5417214	"A perfume that promises to transport you into a fantasy world filled with dragons and warriors and princesses? Sign my nerdy heart up. Although I don't think the name and the scent itself actually correlate very well, this is a very enjoyable fragrance nonetheless. Just don't expect something that resembles a ""Dragon's Kiss"".To me, this almost smells like a gourmand set on fire. As others have mentioned, amaretto is definitely the most prominent note here. It's very loud, boozy, slightly bitter, and undoubtedly chock full of almonds. There is a touch of smokiness all throughout the duration, but it is not an acrid, burning fire sort of smoke; it's kind of like that oddly pleasant smoke from recently extinguished birthday candles. Nice and cozy, maybe even a bit fluffy. The drydown is a delicious concoction of musk, bitter almonds, benzoin, dark chocolate, and amber. Vetiver, patchouli, neroli, and rose add a much-needed touch of earthy green crispness to the otherwise excessively sweet composition. Although the description makes this seem purely feminine, I think it actually probably should've been marketed as a unisex. It's a really ""grown-up"" scent fit for anybody who likes their fragrances strong.There's a lot going on here, and it definitely can venture into headache-inducing territory. You do have to be in the right mood to appreciate this scent. But when that time comes, you will definitely revel in it."	positif
1026	19673446	A Sultry Delight The only-ONLY- reason I can't give this five stars is because on me, it does not last as long as I would like for such a pricey perfume. The staying power on my skin is similar to what you'd expect form an Eau de Toilette, not an Eau de Parfum. Sometimes I will dab a little on the inside collar of my shirt, where the fragrance tends to last a bit longer so that I can enjoy it throughout the day. The rollerball mechanism does not over-dispense as some can (which might explain why the scent doesn't seem to last for me). However, given that this is a fairly expensive choice, I appreciate that you can be judicious with application! I find the scent itself to be sultry and spicy, yet comforting and sugary. The top notes don't last very long but are nice while they do, having a pleasant pungency that is reminiscent of citrus. There are nice floral notes that present themselves after the top notes waft away, despite that I wouldn't call this a floral scent by any means. Warm and powdery vanilla is the most lasting note, and the one I can still smell on my skin hours after I've applied the perfume. It reminds me quite a bit of TF's Tobacco Vanille, without the smokiness of tobacco. This is a joy to wear!	positif
1027	23249736	I have to be careful with perfumes as I get migraines and very strong scents seem to set them off. For this reason I am wary of trying new scents but this looked light and refreshing so I thought i'd give it a go!Embrace Green Tea & Pear Blossom is described as a 'modern fresh floral fragrance that opens with crisp earthy notes that bloom into a radiant heart of Peony and Orange Blossom. At the base, fresh comfort is felt as Sandalwood mingles with notes of Skin Musk for a confident finish'. I am adding this here as I am finding it difficult to describe the scent - floral (yes but not too much), light (yes), citrus notes (yes, but again not too much). I have to say I didn't get the Sandalwood but I don't think I have a very educated nose!I am enjoying this Eau de Toilette nevertheless!Why am I not giving it 5 stars? Well the scent is delivered in a large box but the bottle is much smaller than you'd imagine. This size is great for the handbag which is good really as whilst this is a great smell it really doesn't last long at all so you'll want to re-apply it throughout the day.The price is good value. Much better than some that I have bought in the past. If I could I would give this 4.5 stars! A delightfully fresh scent and not too sweet/heady - great for everyday use	positif
1028	6251354	Being a mother of a toddler and a newborn doesn't leave much time to pamper and beautify myself. This is where a wonderful smelling perfume can transform you into feeling like a yummy mummy. Daisy daydream is the perfect summery fragrance which left me feeling fresh, even if the bags under my eyes suggested different. I'm not one for heavy floral fragrances which can leave me smelling like I fell into a garden centre!!!!! But this has an added fruity scent which keeps it sweeter and younger. This scent I would say lasts 4-6 hours which isn't too bad for daytime, however personally I'd say it's not strong enough to be a night time scent. The way I rate perfumes sometimes is by how many compliments I get about it, it's always nice to be told you smell good but for me it also means that it's a likeable fragrance and it works well for me. Many compliments were definitely received when I used Daisy Daydream so it's a thumbs up from me so far. I usually find it so hard to try new perfumes as I know what I like but this will definitely be on my shopping list once it's used. (By the way, how cute is the bottle!!!)

1031	4775993	warm, sweet. Absolutely love this perfume. Wanted to smell it after reading reviews on the Sephora website. When I finally smelt it in store I immediately loved it. The instant coffee fragrance is so unique but it wears off nicely. The woodsy yet sweet scent that is left on your skin is beautiful. It lasts very long on me and on my clothes. Will definitely repurchase once I run out. Packaging is beautiful too.	positif
1032	5419262	I absolutely love the sultry scent combination and incredible lasting power of this fragrance! This one combines coffee, jasmine, vanilla, and a host of other yummy notes. I sprayed it on in the early evening and woke up smelling my perfume as though it had just been applied. Everyone who has smelled this on me thinks it's a fantastic fragrance, and I get compliments all the time. It's strong and heavy, but it's another one knocked out of the park by YSL, IMO.	positif
1033	16715185	My absolute favourite perfume and has been for years now! Smells great, a little bit goes a long way, it's long lasting with a sweet scent. Out of all the opium fragrances this one is definitely my favourite, in my opinion the others don't compare! The packaging is also lovely and feels luxury which is nice since the price is high but no higher than any other high end brand so can't complain about that. Couldn't recommend enough!	positif
1034	24284958	"Wow, wow, wow- first impression. I don't personally smell the coffee in this perfume (though it gives me an energized sensation), but I LOVE the ""sweet, sultry"" vanilla (my favorite scent EVER) mixed with the ""elegant, feminine"" notes of the white flower. What a beautiful fragrance! It would be perfect to wear on a date or as a Mother's Day gift for any woman or young woman. I'm in love!!! I seriously can't stop smelling this one."	positif
1035	14973893	I personally think the bottle can be more designed because it's not quite noticeable within my perfume collection. But I love the fragrance a lot. The floral scent is really gentle, a little strong at first because I spray directly in my clothes for long-lasting purpose it. But the fragrance diffuse little by little and even my friends can smell it for half of the day as they stayed next to me. I think it is the best and most important property of a perfume and this achieves it 100%.	positif
1036	4871816	good value, travel-friendly, reusable, wonderful, long lasting. I absolutelly LOVE this fragrance!!! I am such a girly girl and this perfume makes me feel like a beautiful QUEEN! OMG! The smell makes me feel like royalty. When I spray this on I feel like there is no one on my level. I am on a next level and everyone has their eyes on ME! This scent definitely helps you to escape reality!	positif
1037	7824650	This is my go to perfume for date night. I have never had anyone complain about my perfume being too strong and people always gush over my scent when I wear this. It smells floral and can turn out to be a completely sexy/flirty fragrance for many occasions. The staying power is pretty decent-I tend to carry the rollerball or the mini with me for touch-ups. The bottle is also really pretty!	positif
1038	10549157	So I got this free from influenster to try, and I have to admit, I'm always hesitant with fragrance. I have a very select few favorites that I don't venture out from, and a lot of certain perfumes give me a headache. This stuff surprised me, it smells SOOOOO AMAZING! No headache, just pure amazing! And the scent is so perfect for spring/summer! This will def be added to my permanent list of favs!!!	positif
1039	4793559	I have thousands of dollars of perfume, and I've been on a lifelong hunt for the perfect floral fragrance. I don't think I knew what I was looking for until I smelled this. It's an ever changing scent with such depth that doesn't stop you from noticing it throughout the day. Truly does have a wax note to it, but not at all in a negative way. More like a nostalgic mix of wax candy, lipstick and flowers.	positif
1040	25489845	Fragrance and perfumes are definitely a hobby for me and the perfumes that stick with me the most have a story or memory that goes along with the scent. I received a sample of this in my Sephora Play box. The smell instantly reminded me of putting on my grandmother's lipstick at her vanity when was young and she was getting ready to go out. It's not a fragrance I would wear everyday but it absolutely captures the moment it intends to. Its very powdery and soft and last a long time on the skin. 	positif
1041	11787586	I bought this fragrance on a review alone and online. I was very surprised and so pleased with this fresh summer fragrance! To me, this is a glorious spring/summer scent. It is sunny fizzy lemons drying down to a really soft and spicy couture lace wrap!In my opinion is the best perfume of the cruise collection escale of Dior. Smells clean and sophisticated...all you would expect of a Dior fragrance! it is in my 'will always wear' collection! I highly recommend it.	positif
1042	12987788	This was one of the first high end perfumes I ever owned, and it's dark musky tones made me feel like an adult when I was a teenager. It's lasting power is insane! I would wear it out and my dad (who hated the smell) would always comment on how he could smell it when I got home. It has such a nastolgic smell to me and is more of a cold winter time fragrance, due to how warm it smells. This scent will always have a special place in my heart!	positif
1043	17885104	One of my favourite perfumes.<br />It has such a unique smell to it, there really is nothing like it. I’ve smelt Christian Dior’s Poison and I didn’t particularly like it. But hypnotic poison is absolutely gorgeous.<br />It is quite pricey so I only really wear it on special occasions, but there is not a fragrance like it. <br />The scent will last on your skin all day aswell so no need to respray.	positif
1044	7836144	This might be one of the most wonderful fragrances I've ever smelled. It's fresh and aquatic and deep and it reminds me of skinny dipping. I am addicted to this perfume. Every time I use it, I can't stop smelling my wrists all day long. It's a wonderful scent for summertime, and honestly, I wish they made air fresheners of this stuff so I could just spray it around my whole house.	positif
1045	19068896	These fragrances are amazing! I bought this sample kit from Sephora and I was amazed with all the scents. They are very different and fresh smelling! Especially the orange scented ones. I get tons of compliments and it's not as popular of a perfume so you don't have to worry about smelling like everyone else! Truly unique scents and make a great gift to someone searching for their unique scent! Long wearing without being over powering!	positif
1046	16957844	"Love ?? the soft gentle fragrance of Dove Pink, the scent is lovely. Hours after showering with this particular Dove Bar, I've had a complete stranger come up from behind and ""smell the bare skin of my shoulder"" and ask what ""perfume fragrance"" I'm wearing because ""you smell delicious."" A bit frightening being a stranger getting so close and personal, but she meant no harm - she really wanted to know the fragrance. Lol. It smells that good and leaves your skin so soft. Love this!!"	positif
1047	12948388	L'Oreal Paris Hydra Genius Normal/Oily Skin Daily Liquid Care 3.04 fl. oz. Box actually does exactly what it says it will do. It's a light moisturizer that absorbs immediately. I have dry skin so I would like a heavier moisture, but this is probably great for oily skin. The reason it is not 5 stars is the fragrance. It's very perfumed and smells like that water fall like scent. I have sensitive skin, so I would prefer that this was fragrance free.	positif
1048	16083042	I got the Giorgio Armani voxbox to test which included the SI Intense frangrance. SI Intense is a lovely fragrance that I believe would make the perfect evening scent. Upon first testing it my opinion was that it would be perfect for a more mature, sophisticated woman. Of all the perfumes I own SI Intense may be one of the heavier scents but still smells like something I’d wear! I think if you like rich scents SI Intense would be a good buy for you!	positif
1049	18249492	This product is absolutely amazing, I've had a couple of perfumes from this brand that I really liked, but this one takes the Favorite Spot! Such a fresh fragrance, balances perfectly the little hints of vanilla and raspberry with some floral scent, last literally all day long, without needing to reapply and without being too strong (I can't handle too strong perfumes, gives me headaches), which allows you to feel confident wearing it, you just know you're going to smell awesome all day long!	positif
1050	5080302	I'm not a huge perfume fan, and find that most give me a headache... one day when I was in Sephora I sprayed this one on a whim for some reason, and fell IN LOVE. although it doesn't last all day, it has such a unique smell. It smells very organic and not at all that fake floral smell you often get from floral fragrances. Quickly became my signature scent. SO AMAZING.	positif
1051	16347390	I agree with all the ladies, I love Narciso's perfume toilette and here you will see me also adding the hair mist the bottle is almost finished but I had to show you, not only is the their fragrance and scent is nice, but also the hair mist is amazing! spray it and feel amazing trust me people are gonna ask you what did you use on your hair once they smell it whether on elevator or anywhere you are!

1052	25760690	One of my 3 favorite perfumes This is one of the very few that soon after trying it out, just by chance, from the bag of samples I received, I went out and purchased. To give you an idea of what appeals to me, the only scents I wear, so far, and I’ve tried a lot, are La Vie Est Belle (strangely enough my husband started using the body wash of this and didn’t know what it was but I commented one day on how good he had been smelling...when he showed me what he had been using I was like “aw for real? You’ve been using my perfume body wash!” Lol. He smelled great using it. So maybe I go for more neutral toned scents...); D&G Light Blue; and Gucci’s Bamboo. I am fond of Hypnose, Poppy Flower and Flowerbomb but they aren’t ones I love to wear anytime anywhere like my 3 absolute faves. I don’t know if that helps, or even if they are similar as I’m not good in naming the underlying scents. But I think Bamboo is a bit heavy at first but lightens up quickly, and lasts most of the day for me. Enough for work. I always get compliments. It really seems more of a neutral scent to me - not solely feminine or masculine. I would agree that it’s somewhat woody and earthy with a subdued floral scent - one I can’t explain. I would also say it’s more of a clean scent. Not clean like the actual perfume “Clean” which I like and wholeheartedly think is a clean scent. Bamboo is just a mix of those characteristics. I guess that’s what I should start looking for in fragrances if I want to find more. Woody, earthy, subdued floral, clean and somewhere between feminine and gender neutral. Ha, no wonder it’s hard for me to find favorite scents...I sound a bit complicated.	positif
1053	15299327	The packaging and bottle itself are beautiful. It's a nice size, not too big to put in your handbag. The whole bottle just looks gorgeous and quite posh. I didn't however like the smell. It is a very strong, floral smell, and in my opinion quite over powering. I prefer a sweet, light smelling scent. The perfume lasted quite a while too which is what you want from a fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1054	10552791	I purchased this perfume on-line from Nordstrom's a month ago because everyone talked about how strong it was and how you didn't have to use a lot. I absolutely love the fragrance. I bought the biggest size for $115 but the scent throw s not strong enough for me. No one even smells it or compliments me on it unless I asked them to smell it up on my neck or clothes. I should have tested it first. I love my Eau De Parfum stronger!	positif
1055	15301317	I received a sample size of this and to be honest if I had read the fragrance notes beforehand this perfume wouldn't have interested me, they don't scream fruity and fun (i'm a fruity perfume kind of girl) but I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a gorgeous scent that's subtle but also packs a punch (if that makes sense) it smells very expensive and it's definitely going on my Christmas list!	positif
1056	10823172	This is one of my favorite fragrances. The first time I got this, it was a gift when I was in college. I love the scent of this perfume from Dolce & Gabbana. It has this very light citrus smell that I love the most. Not to mention it is long lasting. For my experience, it lasts for the whole day through with just a few sprays. I got this again from MUA swap and I'm very glad to have it again! :D	positif
1057	10961910	Smells divine if you are a fan of stronger floral fragrances. I received this as a present and I fell in love with the smell the moment I sniffed it. True to the classic D&G The One, the rose twist in this scent makes it a go-to for me. I love the rose gold finish of the perfume bottle, it adds a nice touch. The only downside to this is the perfume does not last very long. After a few hours you need to reapply, or carry a roller ball with you for touch ups.	positif
1058	12414224	Hands down one of best smelling perfumes around. Anyone can wear it. It's fruity but not too sweet. It has a nice group of base notes(sandalwood and grapefruit) that let the top notes (red currant and kiwi) and middle ones (watermelon) blend well. I recommend this fragrance to everyone. I'm probably on my 4th or 5th bottle. Definitely my go to scent all year round.	positif
1059	18409968	This fragrant smells very spicy and strong like men's cologne at the opening. I really hated it initially. I never thought it would transform into a feminine scent in 30 minutes. I hated the opening, but once you can get past the spiciness, it's all soft sweet creamy delight like a soft pillowy fluffy cloud all the way through. It lasts and lasts all day on me. I only had to apply it once. Unlike most fragrances that open like royalty and end up like rags, this perfume is the opposite! It smells amazing both my clothes and skin.	positif
1060	13336864	Smells amazing!!! The body wash/shampoo/bubblebath falls short for me. It doesn't foam up the way I would expect a product labeled as bubble bath should, and the scent is faint and doesn't linger.  I love the rest of the fresh cream line though! The lotion smells like fresh homemade whipped cream, and I love to layer it with their fragrance from the fresh cream line and my Armani Si perfume. If you love vanilla scented things, you will love this line.  	positif
1061	6184075	I was pleasently surprised by how long lasting this fragrance is. I am extremely sensitive to smells (migraines) and this perfume didn't trigger one. That's a plus for me. My coworkers complimented me throughout the day, my husband could still smell it on me when I came home from work. The scent is light and pleasant great for daytime. I received this product as a free sample From Influenster and Kat Von D Beauty.	positif
1062	17826742	In my search for a new fragrance I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Sephora and the Bay made me samples of about 6 perfumes that I could try and while this was not my fave at the time I was in the store it was the one that I enjoyed the most during the testing period. The middle and bottom notes are more dynamic and less sweet than the top note which is what I like. At the end of the day I could still smell it and enjoyed. This makes a nice date night scent as my husband could not help but inhale the fragrance!	positif
1063	19613656	This is my signature scent as I wear this almost all year except in the hottest part of summer, where the heat just turns it kind of skunky/skanky. This perfume reminds me a lot of my favorite perfume growing up, Samsara by Guerlain. It's like Dahlia is her toned downed, more playful sister. As if Samsara were stripped down to more simplistic notes. I guess I should have started this off with my scent preference...I absolutely love the combination of jasmine with sandalwood. To me, there isn't a more perfect mix of fragrance. So naturally I was drawn to this lovely rendition from Givenchy. Golden mirabelle plum, jasmine and other white florals which I can't identify because the jasmine is the star, sandalwood, vetiver, and a clean patchouli. The sandalwood in this is a gorgeous creamy, but-not-vanilla-reminiscent, sandalwood. This sandalwood is a soft woody earthy scent that I believe to be a true representation of real Mysore sandalwood. Others have stated this one is a sweet fragrance, but I have to disagree. The plum does give a bit of sweet brightness to the juice, but it doesn't distract from the floral woods that's at the heart of this perfume. I also have to disagree with the few who said this fragrance is powdery. I loathe powdery scents with a pasion! There is nothing old lady about this perfume, but it's not screaming youth either. This is a juice for a grown ass woman in her full power! I feel sexy and confident when I wear it. I find it an appropriate scent to wear to almost any occasion even the office. It is a strong perfume, but not one that would gas people out in an elevator. I think it's probably because the sillage on this is light. It's there, but it's very subtle. The lasting power of the edp is impressive! I took my winter coat out of storage and smelled Dahlia waft up as soon as I opened the bag, from a year ago and after a dry cleaning! I will continue to buy this until they discontinue it and then I will scour the globe looking for all the remaining bottles.	positif
1064	15712501	I have a hard time with perfume because it takes very little for a fragrance to trigger a migraine. The first time I smelled this, I was in love! I purchased it immediately and now consider it my signature scent. I also have the original Ange ou Demon and hate the way it smells. Everyone has different preferences and different fragrances smell differently on people due to body chemistry. I highly suggest stopping in a store to test this before purchasing, but make sure this one is on your list to try.	positif
1065	17775395	I am a sucker for gift sets and perfume sets for starters. Secondly I am obsessed with Marc Jacobs fragrances. I originally bought Dot because the bottle looks like a ladybug to me and my mother who passed away was obsessed with ladybugs her entire life so I actually bought it as kind of a memento until I smelled it. Unlike the floral fragrances of my other Marc Jacobs perfumes, I think Dot has a spicey but still clean scent. It lasts all day on me and I have gotten so many compliments when I wear it. I love it.	positif
1066	4795620	polarizing, dry. It's a beautiful incensy perfume and I will very likely go back to it at some stage in my life. Right now, is just not that season. I agree with the person who said it smelled like really good Champa incense It's a very dry scent and I think I wanted something a little more luscious. But this will definitely remain on my mind as a very particular fragrance that I'll buy the 3.4 oz bottle of...at some point.	positif
1067	15301105	This perfume comes in a lovely bottle and is a good size to carry around for a resprays throughout the day. It is exactly how it is described and smells lovely when it is first worn. The fragrance doesn't seem to last all that long though, hence the need to reapply throughout the day. I have worn it more frequently as a daytime fragrance and would definitely purchase this product again as it is a lovely subtle scent. I just wish the smell lasted longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1068	6248937	I think this product is amazing. I really struggle to find perfumes that you can still smell the fragrance of by the evening. On the first day of using this product we had a works bbq and even after being stood in the smoke for a couple of hours the scent of ck One was still strong and actually masked the smell of smoke. Amazing definetly be using this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1069	10908944	I bought this gift set for myself about 1 month ago and I still use these perfumes today. Most perfumes are quite pricey just for one package, but the Clavin Klein variety comes with multiple fragrances for just $40!! The perfumes, in opinion, smell wonderful and are great quality. I have sensitive skin and these do no irritate me. The one downfall is, I think the scent can last longer. It lasted me about 8 hours, but started to wear off. But I highly recommend this product!	positif
1070	4802307	This perfume smells sooo good, it kind og reminds me a little bit to viva la juicy by juicy couture and that one is one of my favs. So if u like that one you will love this one. It is a very sophisticated yet a little floraly. The scent really lasts along time. I received it for reviewing purposes but i am very honest and all opinions are my own. I am very impressed by this fragrance. Im thinking about purchasing the full size! Go try it out guys, you will not be disappointed	positif
1071	10533962	I received my Tender Romance sample in the mail and to my surprise it smells wonderful! I am extremely particular about the scent of fragrance I wear. I love a sweet and suddle and this hits the nail on the head! I only hate that when I opened my sample bottle, it didn't have a spray nozzle. Some of my perfume spilled out and I was a little upset about it. I will definitely be purchasing a bottle of this once my sample is gone.	positif
1072	4906609	I've been searching for a perfume that smells amazing on me for the summer (or anytime really), and I discovered this one but I was scared away by the price tag on the small bottle size. I'm so glad this comes in a rollerball(I tend to rehome them into atomizers) because I really need this scent in my life. It's soooo spicy, and sexy. I'm in love! Now I want more Tom Ford fragrances but my wallet isn't ready.	positif
1073	10557295	I love love love this fragrance! I'm a sucker for gardenia scents but not every perfume gets it right. The staying power seems to be pretty good as I smelled it on my skin and clothes still at the end of the day. The scent is perfectly floral with a tad bit of sweetness. I received this as a sample for free from Influenster. It in no way changes the way I feel about the product.	positif
1074	5417744	This fragrance reminds me of a scent from long ago, only thing is, I cannot remember which one. I really like it. It smells very classy, and has an air of sophistication unlike other similar scents I have smelled. There is no one note that stands out to me, but they are so well blended, the mix is amazing. I will be reaching for this one often during these cooler months. I do love perfumes made in Paris the most. Sure seems like they know how to make lavish scents.	positif
1075	25830567	The Bath & Body Works A Thousand Wishes Fragrance Mist smells so good. I use it everyday along with the lotion and perfume.The mist last long all day and I have gotten compliments on how good I smell.I love it better than my other favorite Bath & Body Works Signature Collection Diamond Shimmer Mist - Japanese Cherry Blossom - 8 fl oz / 236 mL. But I definitely recommend if you want a nice clean scent!	positif
1076	13063095	Juliette Has a Gun is hands down my favorite fragrance line. I was given a sample of Not a Perfume by a friend and fell absolute in love with it, best scent ever. I recently got the Discovery Kit at Sephora and have been trying the other scents and they are ALL amazing. The only downfall to the full size is the price....I can't convince myself to spend $100 but omg it smells so good. 	positif
1077	4969736	I know next to nothing about fragrances. I went in to sample a lot of different fragrances because I am about to turn 30, and I figure that a woman should have at least 1 perfume. I wanted one of my samples to be Fresh,, and this is the only Fresh scent that I liked. I love the smell of Jasmine--Jasmine flowers, tea, etc. So, I really liked it. Overall, my novice opinion is a contradiction--it's bold but light.	positif
1078	6069234	I love this scent and I'm glad I've finally found the one fragrance I need in my life. I absolutely hate sweet and floral perfumes so so much and this perfume is just nice and fresh and slightly lemon-y and I get a ton of compliments whenever I wear it. My only complaint is that it doesn't last very long due to the fact that it is a a toilette but the smell is too good I can't help but drench myself in this perfume!	positif
1079	16347619	"Marc Jacobs does it again! ""Divine Decadence"" defines this fragrance in two words. It's delicious, and women who like a touch of floral without a heavy, cloying garden scent will LOVE this. It reminded me of a day on the beach with a touch of flowers in sea air. I think a smell a touch of vanilla and maybe honeysuckle, with some woodsy flair. This perfume lasted all day and I only needed a light touch-up for evening."	positif
1080	19045121	Wow. This perfume is amazing. First of all the packaging made this feel like a premuim product and the bottle is an ornament in itself! It looks beautiful on my dressing table as the design is based on a Marc Jacobs Handbag. The perfume is described as woody which I wouldn't normally go for but this scent is warm and rich. It is also very long lasting and will last all day. I actually went swimming with it on and I could still smell a faint fragrance on my wrists.	positif
1081	23313093	Beautiful neroli without the Tom Ford pricing I absolutely love this perfume! It's so fresh and fun but not overly masculine. I'm pleasantly surprised by how long this lasts in comparison with other Jo Malone fragrances. While this is best in warm months, there's nothing like it to brighten up a cold gloomy day. Layers well with countless other Jo perfumes like Orange Blossom and Wood Sage Sea Salt. I love putting on a hoody and smelling the faintness of this scent from the day before.	positif
1082	19912764	I absolutely love this scent. My husband bought me a full bottle for Christmas, and it is my dream casual yet elegant perfume. The notes are mostly musk, pepper, and ambrox with a little iris. What this ends up smelling like (to me) is someone's fresh, warm skin against a cashmere sweater with a touch of bubbly champagne. It's carefree and addictive, and I think the price is pretty reasonable compared to other fragrances on the market. 	positif

1087	4948109	I seen that YSL came out with a new perfume and was eager to smelling it since it has positive feedback, I fell in love with it once I sprayed it, it is a beautiful, sweet sexy scent it is just perfect! YSL you never disappoint in your fragrances (also for men) !! It is on my wish list to have the largest size now. I also asked for a sample since I am hoping it has a good staying power before purchasing.	positif
1088	18439723	I absolutely love the sultry scent combination and incredible lasting power of this fragrance! This one combines coffee, jasmine, vanilla, and a host of other yummy notes. I sprayed it on in the early evening and woke up smelling my perfume as though it had just been applied. Everyone who has smelled this on my girlfriend thinks it's a fantastic fragrance, and she get compliments all the time. It's strong and heavy, but it's another one knocked out of the park by YSL [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1089	4950668	amazing, long wearing. I'm a third grade teacher. A coworker, whose daughter I have in class, stopped me one day after work and told me that her daughter had told her that she loved when I walked by her in class because I smelled so good! Since this is my go-to scent, she was talking about this perfume! I hardly ever repurchase a fragrance, but with this one, I am currently on my second 3 oz. bottle.	positif
1090	5414975	I don't understand the scathing reviews for this perfume. Fragrance is personal; what smells good differs from person to person based on body chemistry and personal preference. I happen to love this perfume but I wont describe why I like the scent (personal). I think it has good lasting on my skin (6 hours) and well priced compared to other high end perfumes like Flowerbomb or Jimmy Choo. The bottle looks so cute on my vanity. I'm happy with my purchase.	positif
1091	25332689	"Amazing scent! My . 1! This is an awesome deal on my very favorite fragrance! You're essentially paying $20 for a 1oz bottle (typically $70). You can travel with the 1oz easily, keep it for yourself or gift it. I use the 1oz to refill my Mon Paris atomizer :) It's sweet (strawberry) scent without being flowery or rosy. It's sugary without smelling like brown sugar or a dessert. The citrusy notes are strong enough to cut through the sweetness of strawberry. It makes me think of fruit salad covered in whip cream with an ice cold strawberry mimosa on the side. It's not a childish scent but not a ""mature"" scent either. It's certainly youthful but the citrus helps to keep it in firmly in the sexy, grown up category. There's also no musk or rose or powder happening here. It's fresh and sweet and bright and it lasts for hours if you get an EDP. Honestly, this is my favorite perfume of all time. I've tried a million on my quest. This is my holy grail, I've finished my first bottle and I'm back to buy this gift set. It's suitable for all seasons!! It's warm and sexy enough for winter, it's bright and citrusy enough for summer. For reference as to whether we have similar tastes: I like sexy, sweet, smoky fragrances that include things like strawberries, amber, vanilla, citrus, jasmine, chocolate, smoke. I strongly dislike rose, powder, green, ""fresh"", soapy and clean or oceanic fragrances. My all time faves: YSL Mon Paris, Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, Versace Eros, Lalique Amethyst, Replica Fireplace, Elizabeth and James Bourbon. If you like similar fragrances to these, you might like Mon Paris! If you have smelled Black Opium and its too sugary for you, you might like Mon Paris. If you sorta like Flowerbomb but it's too flowery and turns powdery on your skin, you might like Mon Paris. Hope you love it!!"	positif
1092	7838511	This is my absolute favorite fragrance. It's a strong scent-if heavy smells bother you then I would skip this one over. For me the strong smell lasts all day on me, which is rare. Perfumes tend to become musky once they mix with the chemicals on my skin, this one doesn't. It's a sweeter smell with notes of patchouli and orange and there's honestly nothing like it. Forever my fave. 	positif
1093	7838810	My expensive date night perfume! I bought this at Sephora for a hundred and ten dollars I believe. It's such an elegant yet flirty smell. I've used it multiple times. I found black opium super feminine smelling which just made me feel more beautiful when wearing it. The smell is almost addicting to me. It's soft and light with an almost floral scent. I loved the hints of jasmine. Not to mention the amazing vanilla bean coffee smell. I also love the hint of orange to the fragrance. The large bottle is beautiful.	positif
1094	7839450	I am in love with this fragrance! It's the perfect scent for a night out or a special occasion. I swear every time I wear this perfume, I get compliments and people asking me what I'm wearing. the only downfall is that it fades faster than I'd like it. After a couple hours, the smell is very faint. Wish it wouldn't fade as fast, especially considering the price! Other than that, I love it. Would repurchase!	positif
1095	7839626	My favorite fragrance! Such a signature scent that is bound to impress. Full of a sweet coffee tangled with vanilla notes that lasts all day long! When i first tried this i only sprayed it once on my arm in the store, later on into the night in bed i was still smelling my arm!! Needless to say i went and bought the full size (smaller ver. 3ml) , it is quite expensive (what perfume isn't to be honest) but you more than get what you pay for. Go try it out!	positif

1097	24184366	"I've never had a ""signature scent"" and never been a person who wears perfume, even for special occasions. I got a sample of this and it changed me. Haha. Normally when I smell a perfume there is a certain element of the fragrance that I don't like, or nothing wows me. This is the only one I've ever loved. :') I'm not saying it will be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm so glad I found it! "	positif
1098	17821886	Love this fragrance, it is a bit of a stronger smell so if you prefer something more subtle, this may not be for you. However, every time I wear this I receive compliments on the scent and I always talk it up because it smells so good. I purchased the travel size spray and it hasn't lasted me that long because it is my go to perfume now, so when that runs out I look forward to purchasing the bigger bottle!	positif

Characteristic for official cold eveningsDefinitely recommend it .. its price is very appropriateOne of the most beautiful oud perfumes everIt is the perfect smell.&nbsp;It is not too heavy and it keeps its scent all day.It lasts very long.Has a very light smell, but it definitely stands out. I've been using it for years	positif
1100	17739465	This fragrance is a men's caloghn but me and my bestfriend are women and we love it. So I think it's more of a unisex scent. Men or women would be able to wear it I can really explain the smell but the notes are lovely it is like no other perfume I have worn it's spicy yet woody earthy and citrusy. It has top notes of bergamot, ginger and lemon. Middle notes of spices, white pepper, basil, and violet leaf. Base notes of Tonka bean, Tahitian get over, and cedar.	positif
1101	22749091	I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this perfume in the post, I'm usually a one scent kind of gal and very seldom try out new fragrances, so when this arrived in the post I wasn't too sure what I would think of it.

1102	4871525	good value, reusable. I'm very picky about the perfumes and scents that I wear but I must say that this perfume is the BEST thing I have ever worn! It smells light and sweet, but not too florally. Every time I wear this fragrance I am approached by strangers and complimented on it's scent! I received this product as a free sample and haven't worn any other perfume since then. Simply stated, this perfume is my favorite and I plan to purchase this for a long time!	positif
1103	4871833	I recieved this perfume to try for FREE from Influenster.com and I have to tell you that I am in love with this fragrance!!!!

I totally recommend that you yourself try this amazing scent and you too will be a believer of this fragrance!. FlowerbombAddict . influenster	positif
1104	5188200	I'm a perfume junkie and have a large collection- but there is something special about Flowerbomb. It's a sexy and sensual floral that's not too sweet or cloying. I always get compliments when I wear this. The staying power is excellent- I can still smell it at the end of the day. I love how unique this scent is! Other fragrances I like for reference: Derek Lam 10 Crosby Ellipsis, Burberry Body, Gucci Guilty, Miss Dior, Issey Miyake L'au D'Issey, Prada Candy.	positif
1105	4867317	This fragrance is very delicate yet powerful. Personally I adore this scent and it is my go to perfume that I can wear daily or to an event. Flowerbomb is sephora's best-selling fragrance, and I know I firmly believe that it will continue to be. And now i will just say, the rollerball is super convenient and tiny bottle is so cute! This lasts a few hours and you will get compliments, and you will be a happy person who smells like sweet sweet heaven. Try this out!	positif
1106	5091276	This perfume is the ultimate scent! And with that said, it is very strong and powerful with a hint of soft that with time it slowly mellows out to a long lasting smell that will have anyone around you curious. I've used this twice and have been complimented several times, the lady at a coffee store, at the post office and at the mall. I'm opting for the regular sized bottle because the travel size has mini pieces that's a bit confusing and I'd target hyatt have the full size. I do recommend this fragrance.	positif
1107	4852820	From the name of this fragrance Flowerbomb I expected it to be a really floral scent which has never really been my thing. I was shocked at how amazing it smells. It has a very sensual musk that I really love. The oil formula and the very well designed dropper also sold me on it. The oil moisturizes your skin instead of drying it out like an alcohol based perfume. The dropper makes it easy to apply exactly where you need it.	positif
1108	7825146	"I absolutely love this fragrance! I worked at one of the top Perfume chains for close to 10 years. I am the type of person who only wears perfumes that smell ""different"" ,because so many perfumes replicate each other. You could own 5 different frangrances that all smell identical! Not Flowerbomb. One of the unique things about this fragrance, is that it takes 1000 flowers to make this scent. Many fragrances use synthetic oils. It's nice to know that you're getting what you pay for here. So Classy."	positif
1109	16081356	I find the entire flower bomb range to be quite nice smelling.AMAZING fragrance. I love the general style that V and R promote, their clothes and choice of makeup. The perfume comes in a lovely package, This is my go to fragrance. It smells divine and has a very distinctive scent and it is without fail that I receive atleast 10 compliments a day when I wear it. It smells ultra fancy without the price tag.	positif
1110	14305706	If you love the smell of the beach then get this. I was hesitant on getting it originally because of the price. I eventually caved when Sephora had the 15% off coupon. I absolutely love this stuff. It's my favorite for when I don't want to wear a heavier perfume (I wear YSL Mon Paris). It's scent is just amazing and it really does smell like the beach. Perfect light summer fragrance	positif
1111	5099100	good value. I'm not a fan of vanilla based perfumes as they usually are too sweet and give me a headache. This perfume, however, has been my signature scent for years. Out of all the beautiful fragrances in my collection, this one is still my favorite and my boyfriend says it's the one that smells like me, even though I frequently switch up my perfume. I'll always go back to this one.	positif
1112	19517281	This perfume is the first in years where I have received unexpected compliment, firstly from a barmaid who you may say anything would smell better than beer, followed quickly by the wife of a friend. This really is a nice scent and makes you feel good putting it on, I was worried that I couldn't smell it on me, however the compliments reassured. It has more depth to the fragrance than the regular summery La Vie Est Belle, perfect for evening wear [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1113	5245343	I just received this in the mail, so I can in no way speak for sillage or longevity. From initial spray alone, I'd assume it has moderate sillage. Those around you could smell it, but I don't see it leaving a heavy trail or announcing itself into each room. This review is basically to review the SCENT ITSELF. This was a blind purchase. I've never purchased a perfume before without even smelling/sampling it first. The description and notes intrigued me though. To give an idea using comparisons- This is sweet, but in a fresh and tolerable way like V&K Flowerbomb, not in a teenage or gourmand edible way. It reminds me a lot of Pinrose Secret Genius, but with the lavender adding a burst of slightly juicy/heady floral. It has a similar vibe as Thierry Mugler Angel, as it has the captivating sweetness with a hint of berries (in this case, lavender).. BUT, no patchouli. Angel to me is a beautiful scent, but the patchouli makes its initial blast quite pungent and almost medicinal. It can be offensive to some. And the end of the dry down with Angel fades to kind of a BO scent due to the patchouli. It gets funky.. and it's the reason I've never been able to make it a staple or signature scent. This though has all of the good parts of the aforementioned perfumes and none of the not-so-great parts! It has a warm and comforting vanilla to it that envelopes you in comfort. It's not a fake, artificial vanilla or one you want to eat. It's a mature and luxurious vanilla that keeps me wanting more. A bit of powdered sugar remains in the dry down, like the kind atop a plate of fried dough. But the mature vanilla keeps it from being to candy-like. This is a very polite gourmand I would say. For reference, I'm a huge fan of gourmands and sweet fragrances like flowerbomb, Dior hypnotic poison, Comptoir Sud Pacifique Vanille Abricot and Tom Ford Noir Femme.	positif

1115	10553167	"This is the BEST smelling perfume I have found. It is the only fragrance I wear. The scent ""lingers"" for days or even weeks. It's not over powering but yet it has a strong statement. I have been told that I can be smelled well after I leave a room or walk down a hallway at work, and not in a bad way. There are a few friends of mine who have discovered this amazing perfume since meeting me and they love and wear it also"	positif
1116	10553730	"I have never been into floral perfumes as they tend to smell too ""grassy"" on my skin. I received this as a gift after gushing over how gorgeous the scent is. Very suitable for day and night wear. The dry down of this perfume is simply unique and you won't find anything like it. Light, creamy, floral and a bite of raspberry. Suitable for all ages and is one of my top favourite fragrances."	positif
1117	18789510	This perfume smells amazing and the best thing about it is that the scent lasts all day. I have other perfumes where the fragrance doesn't last so this is a product i would definitely recommend! You can get it in most perfume shops and department stores like debenhams. I always have a spray when i go in there :) the bottle is gorgeous too and a little goes a long way! I'm hoping i receive one for christmas! :-D	positif
1118	20360052	I've tried this perfume from Dior for a long time and I'm so satisfied that I had the opportunity to buy it . It lasts very longer when I put it on my writs , behind my ears and even in my hair . Its scent looks like heaven and it attracts anyone who smells this beautiful fragrance coming from you . I used daily in the morning before I go to university and even at night when I go out for dinner . I do recommend it for Dior perfume lovers , go buy it girls 	positif
1119	15426251	"My mom has this fragrance and I have tried it a few times and all I can say is ""WOW""! I am hoping that she gets tired of it because she has a lot of different kinds of perfume and that she'll just give me her bottle. It's smell so pretty and reminds me of flowers. It feels like a very feminine scent and it's subtle not too strong. I would love to have a giant bottle of the perfume. Dior J'adore L'Or"	positif
1120	18414229	Crisp. Airy. Refreshing. It's almost like a citrusy crisp smell without being your typical lemon or orange. Personally I'm a huge fan of things that remind me of being outside in the summer, and this perfume does just that. It's definitely a scent that you either love or hate, so I'd recommend trying it out at your local Clinique counter and seeing how it dries down on your skin, but if you like to smell crisp and fresh, you just might enjoy this fragrance!	positif
1121	5199410	This is the best smelling perfume I have ever smelled/worn. I have never received more compliments on a fragrance than I have with this Chanel. It is my holy grail, ride-or-die perfume and I will use this until the end of time. I have found that even people with all different scent preferences love this fragrance. If you're on the fence about it, BUY IT. Worth every penny!!	positif
1122	7819973	This is a sexy fragrance that lasts almost two days for. It may smell different on your skin, so I would suggest testing it on yourself in stores, because it is expensive. If you are looking to find fragrances like this for less money, I would suggest signing up for a website called scent bird. It costs $15 a month and every month you choose the perfume you would like to choose. And keep in mind that these are high quality fragrances such as, mark Jacobs, DKNY, prada, Gucci, etc.	positif
1123	22543627	I got a sample of this with an Ulta catalog, and loved the way it smelled. I rubbed it on to my skin to see if I still liked it and it smelled even better, so I immediately went and purchased it the following day. This fragrance is fresh, floral, and overall alluring. There is a quality to it that is unique. This is the perfect feminine scent and is definitely worth the price! One of my favorite perfumes ever.	positif
1124	25459666	I have been using this fragrance since my birthday in October last year and I absolutely love it. The smell is so fresh and floral which I adore. The only downside to this product is the price. If you're willing to splash out on a high-quality perfume, then this is the one for you - obviously check you like the scent first. I would definitely recommend this to people who like light and floral fragrances. 	positif
1125	19227409	I had been using the same perfume for 5 years (Sunflowers by Elizabeth Arden), and was growing tired of it. It's gorgeous, but I felt I should start smelling different than I did in high school! (lol) I got a sample of this in a PLAY! Box and used the whole thing up, and splurged on the full size a little later. It is the most unique and lovely scent; it's vibrant and warm without being stuffy. My new everyday fragrance!	positif
1126	15668857	OH MY GOD. I swear by this fragrance, this is the best perfume in the whole world. The bottle is amazing. You just need a spritz or two to last throughout the day. Everyone complements me for it all the time. If I had to use one scent for the rest of my life, this would be it for sure. It's more appropriate for winter though, but I use in summer too, because who cares, I smell amazing! Love it. Make sure to try it at least once. 10/10	positif
1127	17287240	One of my favorite scents for the spring/summer! It seems to meld floral and fruity together very nicely that it doesn't come off as being too sweet. I have gotten more compliments on this than any other scent I own and trust me, I own a lot!!! Every time I wear this I get at least one person who stops me to ask me what perfume I'm wearing, even after I can no longer smell it on myself. Lasting power is great. I find that this fragrance is best for day time or the work place.	positif
1128	17404015	This fragrance is a classic. It is feminine and seductive it has withstood the test of time. Although it is expensive, it is well worth it. Whenever I wear this I get inundated with compliments about how good I smell. Another good thing about it, is that it's smells good on everybody that I've ever been around wearing it and you cannot say that for all perfumes. It is not uncommon for perfume to smell good on one person and not so much on somebody else. This scent seems to be versatile and I highly recommend it for anybody.	positif
1129	16566358	This perfume is so underrated, not that Chanel makes any bad perfumes, but for starters the bottle just isn't as glamorous or sleek as some of their other perfumes. That being said, Chanel does stand by the fact that the fragrance itself speaks for the product and therefore doesn't need flashy packaging. As for the scent itself, it's so incredibly sexy, it's stands as one of my favorite fragrances of all time. Also, a lot of guys like the way it smells, I think it has to do with the Vanilla and bourbon	positif
1130	18371078	I feel like this fragrance is a good introduction it beginner scent for Chanel. It has the classic Chanel undertone, but is light and floral (it smells like a flower that exists in another world). I know most die hard Chanel fans won't like it, but I think this fragrance was aimed at bringing in new customers. I feel like you could start with this and move on to one of their heavier perfumes after a while.	positif
1131	18371268	Gorgeous perfume, but something stopped me from giving it a 5 and that was.. I've smelt it before. Its not a unique smelling fragrance, smells very similar to a lot of fragrances around your beauty halls. I wouldn't say no to it if someone gifted it to me but It isn't one that I would go rushing out for myself. Its super lightweight and fresh, great as an everyday scent.	positif
1132	15663191	It's back!!!! They discontinued this perfume years ago and there was such an online uproar they finally brought it back...at least I assume that's why. I'm just speculating. Anyway, its long been one of my favorites and I snapped up 2 bottles as soon as I could. Hard to describe the fragrance, it isn't like any other. Definitely more light than harsh, it is a perfect summer scent when you don't want to smell like every other chick in the room.	positif
1133	5419284	When I smell this fragrance, I'm immediately hit by a lovely floral scent of lilies. It's sweet, floral, and fresh all at once. In my experience, the staying power is tremendously impressive! One spritz on my wrist is all I need for all-day wear. I'm a person why typically shies away from floral perfumes. However, I absolutely can't get enough of this one! Men seem to love it, too!	positif
1134	10560441	My all time favorite perfume. I have never received so many compliments than when I wear this crisp smelling scent. It stays on unlike many other perfumes I have tried. Believe me, I have tried to venture away from my tried and true fragrance but it's just not worth my time or money anymore to keep trying. Yes, perfume is pricey but this goes such a long way. If you want a more affordable option, try the rollerball (although I do not like it as much). You can get this almost anywhere perfume is sold!	positif
1135	15253701	Vanille Insensee is hands down my favorite fragrance. It's sultry and woodsy without being too heavy for every day use. It can be worn alone as a signature scent (there's nothing else like it), but it also layers extraordinarily well with other warm-based perfumes (like YSL's Black Opium). In my experience, the vanilla base really blooms after about a half hour of application and becomes the dark star of the profile. That sounds weird, but my god it smells amazing.	positif
1136	23484202	My all time favorite dry shampoo! The Blush fragrance is my top choice out of all of them. It smells like Micheal Kors perfume (gardenia scent) which is a plus when spraying in dirty hair! I love how this dry shampoo immediately soaks up all the oils and gives your hair a matte yet sheen look. It seems to last a while too, I can make a bottle last a few weeks (using 3 -4 times a week).	positif
1137	18249899	I liked this fragrance quite a bit! I don't usually splurge for designer perfumes but I was pleasantly surprised. It is light and quite long lasting! It reminded me of a white wine scent at first but it turned into a light floral smell. I love the idea of having his and her scents and they intermingle well with each other. This would be a great gift for a bride and groom or anniversary because the bottles can be engraved!	positif
1138	5224184	highly scented, long lasting, subtle. this smells like sunscreen, fake beach smell and a little sweet - it reminds me of Jennifer Anniston's fragrance if I recall correctly. The scent is good, but not too different from some fragrances you can find that will lost longer (real, spray perfumes) for less. The candle itself is high quality - highly fragranced (you need not even light the candle to smell it in a small room), and it burns evenly without extra care. However, given the size - I think these are ridiculously overpriced.	positif
1139	5217546	I really enjoy any scent with sea salt notes and this smells just like salty, sunkissed skin. I think this perfume really comes to life though when Armani's Sun d'Gioia is layered on top. This gives the overall fragrance a deeper, warmer impression. Since layering perfume can be expensive, I buy Beach Walk in the rollerball version and apply it to my pulse points. Then I spray Sun d'Gioia on top. Perfect for year-round wear.	positif
1140	6253588	"The bottle doesn't really tell you what to expect when it comes to this scent. I suppose the bottle is quite plain yet elegant but the perfume does the talking. My first thought when I first sprayed this was ""juicy!"". It smelt like beautiful ripe juicy fruit, not synthetic or sickly. The fragrance is so easy to wear. I kept smelling my wrist all the time. The perfume has good longevity too, lasts well into the evening. The dry down was a slight hint of vanilla without being too sweet. I love this!"	positif
1141	7841542	This used to be my go-to fragrance for a long time! I received a big bottle for Christmas one year and fell in love. It looks luxurious sitting on your vanity without being too expensive. The only reason I don't use it currently is because I'm a perfume collector. I have so many scents to wear. It's a nice floral scent that is light, but don't over do it or you'll smell like an alcoholic flower child.	positif
1142	7841591	This scent is the real deal. I put it on a shirt when I received it yesterday to see if it would last and the smell when I checked my closet was still strong with the shirt I tested it on really good. This is now my favourite fragrance, it Smell's so good! I get a lot of compliments. People ask me, what perfume I'm using. My only complaint is the bottle is way too small.	positif
1143	10562298	I wouldn't say this perfume is solely masculine, it seems like more of a unisex fragrance to me. It is a very interesting scent though, kind of a mixture of mint and apple with slight vanilla undertones. The different smells didn't blend super well on me, they sort of just appeared and then faded one after the other. I'd say this is definitely one of those fragrances you should try first to see if you like it on you.	positif
1144	3061611	Lovely fragrance, I came across it when I found a sample in a magazine. I bought it immediately, although I usually take my time when buying perfume. It is a clean, subtle and invigorating scent. I like the fresh, refreshing smell of citrus, followed by jasmine and settling down in a subtle powdery note of vanilla. It lingers around when I move and I absolutely love wearing it. Fast delivery too, arrived safely. Thanks.	positif
1145	5020333	I'm a huge fan of Juicy Couture fragrances. Since it wasn't Viva La Juicy series, I was a little nervous to try it but it didn't disappoint me!!! It is such a beautiful, yet fun and flirty scent that doesn't give me headache like most of perfumes do. My hubby said I smelled yummy when I put this on. I just have a travel size spray but definitely need buy the biggest bottle! LOVE!	positif
1146	7833568	One of my go-to perfume choices because of how light it is. No one will complain that this is overbearing ever! It has a sweet and floral scent which almost smells like vanilla. The bottle is super cute and luxurious looking (such a nice decorative piece for your collection)! This may be a bit expensive for some but I recommend going to Tjmaxx to get yourself a great deal on this. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a light sweet fragrance!	positif
1147	7833609	its a great fragrance that smells very good, it has a very sweet scent to it. it is priced in the usual price range 40-60s. the only down fall of this perfume is that it does not stay on your skin too long. it tends to need to be re-sprayed on within 4 hours. i dont think that i will repurchase this perfume once it ends. the packaging is so cute as well.	positif
1148	22580911	THIS! I used to wear this perfume back when I very first started college. I wore it for many years and then went on to something else. This past valentines day my husband surprised me with the 3.4 oz bottle of this and I forgot how much I love it! The scent is sweet, but it smells grown up still. It is perfect for day or night and any occasion. I love all types of fragrances but this one will always be in my collection. I am absolutely obsessed with it!	positif
1149	18517432	I absolutely love this perfume! It's so fresh and fun but not overly masculine. I'm pleasantly surprised by how long this lasts in comparison with other Jo Malone fragrances. While this is best in warm months, there's nothing like it to brighten up a cold gloomy day. Layers well with countless other Jo perfumes like Orange Blossom and Wood Sage Sea Salt. I love putting on a hoody and smelling the faintness of this scent from the day before.	positif
1150	15668457	One of my favorite fragrances ever! I just felt in love with it the first time I smelled it, when it was still new and didn't give up until I put my hands on it! I believe the scent is long-lasting, I can still smell it on my skin many hours later. I believe I am currently at my 4th bottle and I've never used the same perfume as many times as this one.	positif
1151	22747233	This perfume smells absolutely gorgeous. Its very fruity yet sweet giving a soft scent. You can really smell the peach and cocoa which compliment each other. it definitely a very feminine fragrance. I found the perfume to last all day and have had lots of compliments about it. My husband absolutely loves it. The packaging is absolutely beautiful too, nude and rose gold. Perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1152	4907427	soft, feminine, delicately floral. This perfume is lovely--every woman I sit next to asks me what fragrance I am wearing, and my friends always compliment me on this scent. It is floral, but not overpoweringly so. It is more expensive than other fragrances, but you only need a few spritzes on your pulse points and you will smell nice all day. I typically purchase a new bottle when Sephora offers triple points on fragrances.	positif
1153	10534352	"The ""Gucci Guilty Eau de Toilette Spray"" has a modern and sexy smelling scent.In comparison to other fragrances I use, this one is more mature and sexy. Furthermore, I would describe it as oriental and a bit spicy. Sadly, it isn't long-lasting and it is a bit expensive. I think that this perfume is addressed to adults and not to teenagers because it has a stronger smell. You can actually use it every day, but in my opinion it would be suitable for special moments."	positif
1154	23682351	I love my Gucci bloom perfume. Such a floral, feminine smell but at the same time isn’t your typical scent. I always receive compliments on how good I smell all day when I wear this as it lasts and lingeries near enough all day. The packaging is simple but effective and looks classy. I’ve had mine since December 2017 and I don’t think I can feel a massive decrease in fragrance.????	positif
1155	19205537	My goodness I love this fragrance! It’s hard for me to find a perfume that I love and won’t give me a headache, because I am not into that extra sweet smell and I absolutely love how this smells. I’m a picky person when it comes to scent and I will definitely recommend this! Guys, if you don’t know what to get your loved one or S/O this Christmas, this is it! Gucci	positif
1156	5010738	When it comes to perfume, my style can only be described as schizophrenic. In high school, I wore Clinique Happy, but I was in love with my mum's Coco Chanel, so I adopted it as my signature scent when I went off to college. In law school, I briefly flirted with Shalimar, but I always returned to Coco. Barely two years ago, I discovered Prada Candy, and I began a torrid affair with it - and my husband simply adored it, as well. I never thought that I could find a scent that captured my fancy more than Candy and Coco . . . But then, on a whim, I grabbed a Brown Sugar rollerball whilst standing in line at the local Sephora. I put it on, and I simply couldn't stop sniffing myself. I don't know what it is about this relatively simple, semi-sweet, fresh, light scent that has me so intoxicated. It reminds me of eating my grandmother's lemon meringue pie down in the Florida Keys - simpler times, happy memories, and it fills me with a certain ineffable contentment. I had to buy more. A bonus is the fact that my husband and my coworkers all love it. I do wish that it would last longer, but after spraying it on before going to work in the morning, I carry the rollerball in my purse and dab a little bit upon my pulse points after 5-6 hours. This fragrance literally puts a smile upon my face every time that I smell it. I still love Coco, Candy, and Shalimar, but Brown Sugar has become my daily scent - when I travel, I bring another fragrance, but I think that Brown Sugar is THE perfect South Florida perfume. During our 3 weeks of winter, I'll probably wear Coco and Candy, but the rest of the year when I'm home, I'll be wearing Brown Sugar. (The 4 is due to it not lasting as long as the other scents I wear)	positif
1157	23605644	I love this gorgeous, sweet scent so much!! I am a lover of sweet, almost candy scented perfumes and I found this when I googled the best sweet perfumes. Some of the perfumes on there I already had, such as YSL Black Opium and Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb (reviews to come!) but some I had never tried before, such as Prada Candy (which I have since smelled and I am not really a fan) and this perfume. This perfume was highly recommended to those with a sweet tooth when it comes to scents as one of the base notes in this perfume is marshmallow - ACTUAL candy!!!! The bottle is classy, a black lid atop a gold block on a tall, square glass bottle, and the box the perfume comes in is a sultry VELVET burgundy box that matches the seductive tones of the scent perfectly. I was as overjoyed with the different approach to packaging (velvet! Makes normal perfume boxes made of card so boring!) as I was with the scent. It has base notes of the aforementioned marshmallow, vanilla (another delicious hint of candy), heliotrope and sandalwood (another love of mine). At its heart is jasmine (I love this too; most of my perfumes have jasmine in) and orange blossom, and it’s top notes are neroli, raspberry and tangerine, meaning that the result is a fruity, sweet yet not sickly, lasting scent. Dolce and Gabbana originally launched this fragrance in 1992, only to give it a “fine tuning” and relaunch twenty years later in 2012. I never smelled the original but I LOVE this - good call, D & G! I give this a five star, scream from the rooftops recommendation but I concede that it won’t be for everyone. However I can’t imagine anyone not liking this perfume - it’s so good!!!!!	positif
1158	10663454	I love this scent ! However, if you're not into strong note (especially top and mid), beware with this fragrance . It has a very strong note of pepper (don't know if pepper is one of its ingredient but I always think of pepper when smell this perfume, especially just after applying) at first and sometimes this will annoy people around you . Last long (7-8 hrs) . Recommend for night use or cool weather , 1-2 shots and you're good to go all day !!!	positif
1159	15129692	I love this perfume, it lasts about 5 hours in the skin (that in my case it is a lot of time since even the best do not last on me more than 3 hours).It smells sweet and cute. It has a floral scent to it with a chic twist that will make people turn around and smile at your fragrance. I do not mind the price since to me feels very unique and charming. Would recommend 100%	positif
1160	15671098	Really lovely clean-smelling fragrance for everyday wear. A good choice for the office, being light enough yet having a great lasting power. It's feminine without being overly flirtatious or girly. A formal perfume with a hint of soft tenderness and warmth. My choice for any official appointment. The opening is a bit citrusy but cactus makes it to seem like a milky velvet scent. The heart is very flowery, jasmine, lily, rose. The base is musky-woody.	positif
1161	19647656	VERY LIGHT, DELICIOUS FRAGRANCE! This obviously isn't going to have the same staying power as a perfume or even a deep/musky Eau de Toilette, but that being said, this is simply delicious! It smells exactly the same as the Fresh Cream lotion - which is why I knew I would love this! Wear it alone to have a light, cake-y (or Cap'n Crunch, as my husband says) scent or layer it with other fragrances like I do!	positif
1162	4820380	creamy, super fragranced. I love all the Philosophy body care, and this lotion is thick and luxurious! It's extremely scented...so much so that if I wear it at night my whole bed will smell like fresh cream! No need to wear perfume with this, since its fragrance is so strong! It is a VERY sweet scent, but I love it. It can be a little too much on certain days, but overall I'm a fan!	positif
1163	14302364	Omg one of my absolutely favorite fragrances! Feminine, clean, floral, light...it's such a beautiful scent that you're sure to get tons of compliments on it. It's been around for years and the fact that it's still just as popular says something about it! The staying power of the perfume is great too. You know how you normally stop smelling perfume on yourself after about an hour or so? I find that when I wear Amazing Grace I get whiffs of it all day long. I just inhale deep and love it lol!!	positif
1164	14302413	This fragrance smells like a clean fresh soap. It is completely non-offensive and would likely be ideal for a work environment. It is a very simple scent and it is really subtle. I would highly recommend this for people who don't like perfumes or get headaches easily from scents. People will not even think you smell like perfume but that you just use a nice smelling bath and soap products that linger and make you smell like you just got out of the shower but all day long.	positif
1165	18721826	This is my all time favorite scent. I was actually perfume sampling one day at Sephora. This was one of the samples I decided to try and I'm glad I did. It's light and feminine and smells really good. I'm terrible at describing scents but its not fruity and not really floral, sort of a clean fragrance. I'm sensitive to strong scents but this one doesn't bother me and I'm in love with it. I recommend at least getting a sample to try it out.	positif
1166	6179930	I received this product as a free sample from Influenster. I have also received a sample of Sinner and these two fragrances smell amazing!!! I don't have many perfumes because I am very sensitive to scents, but the Saint fragrance is just too lovely I could smell it all day! The scent is very feminine and has nice sweet floral notes! I recommend this one for everyone and Sinner I would recommend for someone that loves strong notes of perfumes!	positif
1167	6183920	good value, reusable, travel-friendly. I am usually very reluctant when it comes to trying a fragrance that comes from a celebrity or brand that is not focused specifically on perfumes. When I got the kat von d vox box I was so happy that I was proved wrong about a new scent smelling amazing! I love musky scents, as soon as I smelled sinner I put it on and had to buy the full sized bottle a week later.	positif
1168	6184108	I received this product free from Influenster for my honest opinion. This perfume was my favorite of the collection. It's light and very clean smelling. I love how both fragrances in the collection share a lot of the same notes so they smell great layered! Saint is not as over whelming on my senses either. The smell lasted hours but I do keep it on me to reapply throughout the day. The mandarin really stands out to me in this scent and makes me love this for summer!	positif

1170	10550635	I own both of Kat's fragrances and this is my favorite. It's long-lasting and comes in a gorgeous bottle. I picked it up at Sephora almost as soon as they had it and am crossing my fingers it won't be a limited-time thing. This scent is 'darker' than Saint, I can smell peppery notes, dark berries and a woodsy edge. I absolutely love it - it's so different than any perfume on the market that I've tried and worth every penny 100%.	positif
1171	10551034	KatVonD Sinner lists key notes of Patchouli, Wood and Cinnamon.The imagery it evoked for me; black satin sheets, crushed velvet, a dark room, cigar smoke, leather, red wine, red lipstick, lit candles, a gentle touch, a whisper... sin. This is a very sensual scent and I love the way it makes me smell and feel.

1172	6216424	Such a nice option if you are sensitive to traditional perfumes. I have highly reactive skin and artificial fragrance triggers migraines, but I also want to smell nice. This perfume doesn't bother me at all. The vanilla is comforting and sweet. I don't get any grapefruit from it, unfortunately, which is the reason for 4 stars. The scent composition is just a little boring, but I can live with that since it's so easy to wear.	positif
1173	5925211	Honestly...whether this product works or not I think must have a lot to do with body chemistry, like how the exact same perfume can smell different on each individual. For me, both this and the sport luxe does work wonderfully. I apply once at night very lightly after my shower (best on clean skin says the website!) and reapply in morning before I get on with my day. No further touch ups needed. 5- stars for the orignal lavanila because:- I prefer the creamy solid feel of the original, glides well, doesn't irritate freshly shaven pits- fragrance lasts longer, important to me because I work in a scent-sensitive environment where perfume is frowned upon and this very subtle scent allows me to cheat just a tiny bit and really only I can smell it, unless I hug someone :) 4- stars for this sport luxe version because:- this is more of a gel solid and just wasn't crazy about the gel solid feel of this, because it made me feel temporarily sticky, had to fan my underarms and hold them out for a bit to help it dry down- This scent is definitely sportier and I quite like it, but the scent doesn't last as long as the original formulation Both formulas have good and healthy ingredients, and are great at odour control for me. Even after a very sweaty workout, apparently I have zero BO. The ONLY thing that smells is my super sweaty headband (weird huh?). So to really put the deos to the test, I smeared some all around my headband prior to my next workout, and voila, zero odour. Yup. It works VERY well for me! And LAVANILA, if you're reading this, I would do anything to be able to buy Vanilla Amber repeatedly as it's my fave. Why oh why was it limited edition???	positif
1174	5165304	A while back I was talking with a Sephora employee about makeup and we ended up, somehow, on the subject of fragrances. We were both talking about how we enjoyed fresh, clean scents and how many perfumes can lean too sweet. She introduced me to a couple of colognes and I instantly loved this cologne. It smells so pleasant and clean from initial application all the way to dry down. Even hours later, the fragrance leaves behind a very warm, cozy scent. Another aspect that I appreciate is that Luna Rossa Sport is noticeable to other people, but not obnoxiously so.	positif
1175	25896966	I do not wear perfume at all. Most fragrances I have come across make me really nauseous or make me smell odd. However, i was given Prada les Infusions as a gift and I love The scent. It’s long lasting and smells so soft, clean and subtle. It’s a very pleasant smell on me and doesn’t make me ill. I’m glad that I have found a perfume that I can actually wear now. I’d definitely recommend.	positif
1176	5261685	If I could personify this fragrance it would be the definition of the 1951 musical An American in Paris. It's classic and modern all at once. A sweet warm rosy scent without smelling like pure roses, it has more of a jazzy feel to it. It's sultry and sexy yet lighter and flirty. An excellent perfume. Only problem is it doesn't last long on me without reapplying, maybe 4 hours. Not too big a deal to me but I know that bothers some. Give it a try.	positif
1177	5016276	pricey but worth it!. I love love love this scent! I had been spraying it through a tester for over a year in stores before i purchased! If you have ever smelled the Lampe Berger fragrance oils - the Paris Chic smells very similar to this perfume and I LOVE it. Some other scents I'm a fan of are clean, floral, and fresh - like Romance by Ralph Lauren, Chanel Chance Fresh, Light Blue by Dolce & Gabbana, Blue by Ralph Lauren, Walk On Air by Kate Spade, and Tory Burch...enjoy! :)	positif
1178	5113072	I have worn this perfume since I started high school and nothing has surpassed it in my heart. It's a beautiful (yes, I'm using beautiful to describe this fragrance!) floral scent that smells so fresh yet sweet with the perfect amount of rosey. It lasts very well on my skin and even better on my clothes and I have repurchased bottle after bottle, always around the holidays time as the 4.2oz bottle is such a steal especially with the rouge discount.Will never stop buying!	positif
1179	18483642	I know, fragrance is a very personal thing. And I don't really know how to describe the scent. I smell it from a friend and loved it. But I don't know what's the perfume. The moment I stopped by and smell it in the store, I knew that's it! I'm gonna have it! I love it. My current favorite. Not too strong, not too sweet. It's uplifting, grace and romantic.	positif
1180	11169172	I LOVE this scent so much. If you like the smell of roses, you will fall in love with this. This smells like straight up fresh, clean cut roses. It is essential for the spring and would be a perfect gift for any woman in your life that loves roses. I bought mine off of Fragrancenet.com and they sell authenic perfumes for these then half of what you would pay if you bought them at sephora or nordstrom. Definitely recommend this perfume and Fragrancenet.com!!	positif
1181	16081037	I love this fragrance. It combines the feminine smell of chloe with the scent of fresh roses. Its amazing. If this perfume was going to stop being made, I would buy several bottles, that is how much I love it. I am a picky perfume person, but this is a holy grail favorite! Would be such a good gift for someone in my opinion because I think many different types of people would like it and the smell is universally good!	positif
1182	24962875	Chloe love story is a clean and fresh floral scent. The perfume is strong smelling but not over powering and holds its smell whether it be daytime or evening. I find chloe love story to be a romantic yet sensual smelling fragrance which when wearing it made you feel pretty and happy. Whenever I went out I got compliments asking what perfume I was wearing. Definitely one of my favourites scents and I normally go for strong musk based perfumes. Definitely converted. Will be sticking this one birthday and Christmas list.

1183	10529749	Yes Yes Yes! Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau So Fresh Perfume. This product comes in different sizes from small to larger and in rollerball. The smell is light and has a light floral scent. It is perfect for women or men to smell fresh and smell like a pond of fresh flowers on a spring morning. This product is long lasting. I apply it on my neck area, and I be smelling good all day! For the price, I would always repurchase this product! Count me in the marc jacob fragrance crew!	positif
1184	10529988	This is the first high-end perfume I've ever owned and I adore it. It's feminine and flirty but also sophisticated. One issue I have noticed is that the scent seems to fade pretty quickly. I'm not sure if it's just because my nose gets used to the smell throughout the day or if the fragrance itself doesn't last. Regardless, I think Marc Jacobs fragrances smell wonderful and the packaging is always dainty and adorable. I plan to purchase another once I've used this one up!	positif
1185	10530064	I love, love, love this fragrance! It's quickly become my signature scent. I get stopped all the time out in public by people mentioning that I smell good, and/or asking about my perfume. I love the compliments! This is light and floral, but not over powering. I'm very sensitive to fragrance, but have no issues with this one. I'll be buying this for as long as they continue to make it!	positif
1186	10532213	I am a very picky lady when it comes to perfume. I find so many scents over bearing. This is not one of those cases. Daisy Dream is lightly floral and clean smelling, I would say it is the most versatile Marc Jacobs fragrance I have tried to date (I have tried them all and generally like the products). I wear this daily and often receive compliments on the scent! I highly recommend, but make sure you try it in store first- fragrance is different on every body!	positif
1187	10537273	"The best way to describe this perfume is fun. It such a light, fun, and flirty scent. I tend to gravitate to this perfume during the summer months when my go to fragrance (Coco Chanel) would be a little too heavy to wear. The bottle is adorable. My daughters are always asking me if they can ""smell the bee"". I'm not sure I would repurchase and I have so many perfumes, but I definitely don't regret the purchase. "	positif
1188	10537335	I love this perfume. Purely because when I was a child my mother planted honeysuckle on both sides of our driveway leading up to our house. Every time I smell this perfume it reminds me of home, so it may not be the best perfume from Marc Jacobs, but I have had a bottle of it on my vanity since he first released the fragrance. On a more practical note, it's very subtle so if you work in an office environment it's perfect. It will not overpower the room, or make others who might be sensitive to scent, uncomfortable.	positif
1189	23429903	I got this as a present in September and honestly where has it been all my life . Seriously I get so much comments when I put it on.Best fragrances from a perfume I’ve ever seen.It is also strong and stays on for the longest time. Some of my wash cloths still smell like it .officially my signature scent now!!???? I love it so much! Definitely purchasing it again and again!Alien by Thierry Mugler for Women - 0.5 oz EDP Spray	positif
1190	18928163	hey if anyone is wondering about this product it is great for brunettes an helps to add volume, freshness and helps prolong a blowout. So it has rice powder in it which helps to absorb the oils that your hair produces. Love the scent smells great and its like a 2 in 1 in terms of fragrance acts like a perfume for you and your hair espcially if you smoke cigarettes if anyone has any questions about any of the other products let me know!

1191	6256301	Magnetic pour Elle by lacoste has a feminine fruity gorgeous fragrance, I can smell hints of sweet blackberries & jasmine, I've worn it both daytime while at the gym & on the school run.. also on romantic nights out with my husband. The bottle is a stunning pink colour with the fabric Lacoste logo.. this perfume will definitely be on my birthday and Christmas list yearly.. thank you Lacoste for a beautiful scent!

1192	6255835	When I first smelled this perfume I was expecting it to be quite heavy. However it's actually nice and light, and dried down to a pleasant fresh fragrance, not too sweet. The bottle itself is clean and sleek, very modern looking. I've knocked one star off the rating as the lid lets it down, it feels like plastic and squeaks when trying to remove it. I also don't think the scent lasts very long, later on in the day I found it hard to detect.	positif
1193	19366011	Despite what others write saying this is fake I think more like they might be ,this is the genuine item as a former worker in a perfumery it's the real thing yes the bottle isn't frosted as in picture image but that's a google image .But the scent isn't as popular as it was and therefore I think the bottles differently designed than it was .Pungent delicious lingering smell lasts for ages I wear it as a office top up for meetings and fits perfect in my drawer .Awesome price as well as great fragrance	positif
1194	4802056	good value, travel-friendly. This fragrance is perfect for spring and summer! It's subtle, yet distinct. The scent is floral, but not overwhelmingly so. If you adore magnolias like I do, this perfume is perfect for you. I wear it on date nights or anytime I want to smell as pretty as I feel ;) I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. I love it and suggest you give it a try.	positif
1195	4874698	good value, travel-friendly. I had never tried a Ralph Lauren perfume before but so glad that I did. I typically don't like fragrances that have musk but I really did enjoy this one. It has a very very sexy scent and makes me feel great and perfect for a night out, dinner, dates, etc. It also lasts a really long time and I can smell it throughout the date which is a nice surprise everytime. I did get to test Ralph Lauren Tender Romance for free, but all opinions are my own.	positif
1196	6074461	classically feminine. I received a free sample from Ralph Lauren and have been wearing it all day. Initially, my teenage daughter didn't like the scent, but once her friends commented positively on it, she changed her mind. This is definitely a earthy, mature woman fragrance. Not a teenage, wanna fling, smell. I honestly feel great with it on. It's amazing what something as simple as a spritz of perfume will do for a woman.	positif
1197	17078439	It reacts differently with different people’s body chemistry. Turns out that’s why a minority of the reviewers found it awful smelling and said they would never recommend it to anyone. :/I personally didn’t mind the perfume on myself, but I definitely would not want this to be my ‘signature’ scent. I steer more toward fruity, fresh fragrances. This one has a ‘mature’ and elegant tone. Romance is more suited for an evening event, or for a formal business setting	positif
1198	10534216	I just received this in the mail this morning, thanks to influenster! It smells so amazing y'all. I truly believe this is by far the best Ralph Lauren fragrance to ever hit the market. The name says it all. When I smell it, The words Tender and Romance both pop up in my mind. It has a nice sweet romantic scent. I will purchasing a full size bottle once I run out of this one! Thanks influenster, I love this perfume.	positif
1199	10559693	I absolutely love this fragrance!! I received it as a birthday present and it smells amazing! Has a floral scent. It's not too strong or too light, it is just right. It comes in a very pretty box. The set includes a 2.5 oz bath and shower gel, the perfume, a 5.1 oz body mist and a 2.5 oz body moisturizer. I definitely recommend it.	positif
1200	25526304	I love (and own) many fresh smelling perfumes but I find that people can often find fragrances that are marketed as “fresh” as being either too aquatic, too sharp, too soapy, smelling like cleaning products or too heavy on white florals. This one is totally different. It’s a juicy fruity fresh scent that stands out in my collection. The lemon note smells fresh and will not leave you smelling like Lysol wipes or lemon pledge. If you liked the blue #1 edition of the big pony collection or original Ralph, you’ll love this!!	positif
1201	14305532	"I'm so in love with this perfume! I found it in both Ulta and Kohls and couldn't stop smelling it--it has a light, springy fragrance that's both fresh and feminine. I HAD to buy it. It's now my go-to perfume and I wear it almost every day. I hope that it doesn't get discontinued because it's now my ""signature scent""!"	positif
1202	5129950	Magical and eccentric are the best words I can think of to describe this. Black Orchid has become my signature scent and I always receive compliments (by strangers, too!) when I wear it. Since it is such a bold and unique/dark fragrance, it takes a certain type of person to wear this, so I definitely recommend trying it on and smelling it in person first. I will forever be in love with this magical perfume.	positif
1203	15302030	This is a beautiful smelling perfume in a perfect, stylish bottle which is shaped like a handbag with a gold chain handle. This fragrance lasts for hours. It smells bold and exotic. I wore this perfume to a wedding and everyone asked what perfume I was wearing and said how the smell was stunning. The scent lasted for the whole afternoon and evening. This is a summer must have. I think I have found my new favourite fragrance. Marc Jacobs never disappoints. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1204	10550505	I love love love this fragrance! I'm a sucker for floral and rosy scents but not every perfume gets it right. The staying power seems to be pretty good as I smelled it on my skin and clothes still at the end of the day. The scent is perfectly floral with a tad bit of sweetness. I received this as a sample for free from Influenster. It in no way changes the way I feel about the product.	positif
1205	5403361	This perfume smells so good!! it's kinda salty and you can sense the cucumber scent which is very refreshing throughout the day. I wouldn't reccomend this to those who really love strong fragrances, I think females who love fruity and fresh fragrances would like this perfume.this perfume is suits more to day time and the summer, for whenever you're on vaccation.. I'm in love with this perfume!	positif
1206	4796183	I have finally found my signature scent! Don't let this perfume fool you because of how it smells on a test strip or from the bottle. You MUST smell it on your skin to give it a chance for it to develop. This perfume opens with a very loud, sharp note of bitter orange blossoms. Soon after, it mellows into a totally different fragrance. On my skin it becomes a soft and sweet creamy floral with vanilla and sweet orange blossoms. Magnificent. Thank you Hermes and thank you Sephora!	positif
1207	25574418	I had a vague memory of owning this fragrance in my early teens and that it was quite pleasant, although I didn't really wear perfume back then. So when I found it being still sold online for almost nothing, I decided to give it a try. And it really is lovely! It's almost been the only scent I've used since I got it. Love the cinnamoncy, fruity caramel smell with a hint of rose.	positif
1208	19780489	Only reason it’s not 5 stars is because it has no staying power. Granted it’s just the spray & not the perfume but still, longer than 30 mins would be nice! It is hands down my favorite scent! I have multiple lotions, candles & by the picture I shared I’m gonna need to repurchase the spray ASAP ???????? Super sweet feminine smell. I love that there is no muskiness in the fragrance just sweet & smooth	positif
1209	25444987	Bath & Body Works French Lavender & Honey is my favorite scent from Bath & Body Works!! Over the years I have found many that I loved but this is my absolute favorite! It smells sweet and lovely, not over bearing. I think it is absolutely perfect! It is a fine fragrance mist so it feels as though you get more area while using less perfume at a time! Love this smell, highly recommend you visit a store or the website ASAP to see for yourself! 	positif
1210	5037188	Firstly, this is a great value to try all of the scents. I think it's important to give each fragrance in the set a couple of chances. The dry down smells so much better than the initial spray for the majority of these scents. Some of them are very old smelling initially but then develop into a beautiful scent. I can't decide which one is my favorite. I also enjoy layering over Not A Perfume. Great set!	positif
1211	24679939	Unique I really loved this perfumed when I first bought the bottle (after getting a sample). It lasts a very long time on my skin, well until the next day after a night out. However, I'm not sure what happened but after a few weeks I no longer cared for this fragrance because I couldn't shake the peppercorn type of spicy smell in it. Wish i still liked it since it really is such a unique scent.	positif
1212	4775519	I am not a fan of rose perfumes. They're too heavy and normally end up smelling like a funeral home! Then along comes Rosa Excelsa! Soft floral fragrance with rose at the very end of the scent. It doesn't assault your nose and whip it around on top. This fragrance has subtle layers that are missed by undiscerning noses. I feel feminine and light when I wear this. I love how it lingers on my skin. Softly. I'll move and get a whiff, and it smells like heaven!	positif
1213	19229961	Bought this perfume after I ran out of my Marc Jacobs Daisy Fragrance. Do not regret at all, I was deciding between buying the old one or this one and really fell in love with the scent of this one. It's so floral and honestly smells like a dream. Only downside to this is that it can be strong at times so a little goes a long way, other than that, I'm in love.	positif
1214	4687620	sensual, sexy. I'm not usually a fragrance person. It's usually an afterthought, but this perfume has me constantly reaching for the bottle in the morning. I was browsing the store and picked it up more so because the bottle looked interesting than anything else, and tried it on, but I kept sniffing my wrist all day! The smell is deep and mysterious with a slight sweetness that keeps it from being to musky. This scent gets so many compliments	positif
1215	19695611	Crisp and Clean Long Lasting Fragrance I loved the clean and simple packaging this perfume came in. It matched perfectly with the crisp clean scent. I could smell a hint of floral and the smell became more warm after absorbing into my skin. I put it on before I went to the gym for an hour, and I could still smell it on my wrist when I got home. Seems to last a decent amount of time, and endures sweat! {I received this complimentary sample from Influenster for my honest review}	positif
1216	19983111	I love this fragrance but it is a super light fresh floral. When I say super it’s super light so light it does not last me as long as I like it too. But the scent is so nice especially when you’re getting out of the shower before bed it smells so good. The packaging is so adorable and the perfume it’s self is a light pink. I recommend this fragrance for someone who doesn’t like a strong sent.	positif
1217	23311246	Mysterious I bought this because I wanted to try something new. I liked the description, thinking it would be agreeable to me. I'm glad I was right and Mugler is now up there with Guerlain as a perfumer in my book. I put this on my hair in late afternoon and woke up in the morning smelling the most lovely fragrance still. It dries down to the most amazing scent. Will be buying more from the Alien line up.	positif
1218	19077813	All i want for christmas is my Aura Mugler! This stuff smells amazing. Not overly sweet and yet that primal woodsy too. It has tiger liana and rhubarb leaf. The combination makes me feel feminine but not swallowed in an over sweet aroma that's too much. I love how it mixes with my natural scent and my boyfriend usually never cares for perfumes but is extra handsy when I wear Aura Mugler. I'm definately loving that it's also a refillable bottle.

1219	1326198	I am a big fan of sweet fragrances and hugo boss the scent for her us right up my street. The bottle is attractive and you only need a small spray which means it will last a while. Its had sweet and fruity notes that make you smell yummy. Since i have been using this perfume i have had lots of compliments.Great fragrance for any lady to wear in the day or on a night out, leaves you smelling delicious [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1220	15301412	A deliciously sweet intense but not over powering fragrance that lasts!, I put this perfume to test in a gruelling 12.5 hour shift in 35 degree heat! And at the end was asked by my night worker colleagues what it was! The scent is floral with a sweet hint it smells classy if that is at all possible I was very inpressed that it lasted my whole shift considering the heat and the fact that As a midwife I am in contact with a variety of smells and bodily fluids!

1221	15301431	Got the Hugo boss the scent intense for women and I love it. With its peachy, vanilla fragrance its right down my street. Not over powering and It's a nice summer fragrance. It lasts for hours which is what I look for in a perfume but when it fades I really struggle to smell it. I have the 30ml bottle which fits perfectly in my small handbag, fantastic for a weekend away. Would I recommend it though, yes I would. It smells beautiful!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1222	15301436	This perfume is lovely, and I have received so many compliments wearing it. It's not over powering and you don't need alot to smell the fresh scent. It has a mixture of sweet peach, honey and vanilla smells which makes it an easy transitional fragrance from summer months to autumnal ones. It's smells expensive and the bottle is stylish and classy. A really lovely perfume from Hugo Boss A must have, for day time or evening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1223	3172263	This is my absolute favourite fragrance out there. It's so long lasting, and I always get compliments whenever I wear this. I've always loved the burnt vanilla smell this gives out, but the other notes like amber balances it out to a complex sweet scent.It's a shame that this JPG perfume is so unheard of, but trust me when I say that this is one of the most underrated fragrances out there!	positif
1224	1338007	I love the smell of this perfume!!. As soon as I came out of a shower I sprayed a few pumps onto my neck, it smells clean and has such a distinct if scent. My partner commented on it right away. I told I'm it was a unisex fragrance, so he tried it on and it smelled amazing on him too!.Perfume smells different on each individual, I love it!!. It's defo a perfume il be keeping in my collection	positif
1225	13831263	Wonderfuk multitasking product! I love using this hair when I wave it with a curling iron to give some extra beachy texture, and I also love using it on damp roots before drying to give extra volume and lift. The scent is so luxurious, you'll be smelling your hair all day, and you might even get some compliments on the fragrance! It literally smells like perfume, and gives you that model off-duty look. 	positif
1226	6251607	This perfume comes in a lovely green bottle (works well in my dressing room). The scent i found was quite flowery, which i think gives its a glamorous feel. Smells lovely when you first put it on, however I don't think it lasts the whole day (surprisingly as it's an Eau de parfum). Which is why i think it would better as an evening perfume (less hours for it to last!) Would I recommend it to friends? Potentially but only as an evening fragrance... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1227	14906299	This body lotion smells so incredibly good! I use it right after I get out of the shower before bed and the aroma is very relaxing. The scent lasts a LONG time as well. Sometimes if I am in a rush I will just put this lotion all over in the morning and I wont need perfume. It does make my skin soft right when I use it, but after it sits on my skin for a little while it gets a little itchy. It might be just my skin reacting to the fragrance.	positif
1228	16644212	First of all I must confess that I am addicted to coconut smell, that is everything for me, this mist is all about that scent, I give it 4 stars because it is a little bit too intense even fo me-) I would recomment using it before going to bed because it may not combine with your perfume.

1230	14305404	This is BY FAR my favorite scent even out of all my high-end expensive perfumes. It's like this scent is made for me! I love the floral, sexy scent it has. I'm huge on my floral scents but don't always want to smell cutesy, you know? This scent is PERFECTION I cannot rave about it enough. It's not just my favorite bath & body works scent, it honestly is my favorite scent that I reach for all time. I just wish they sold a bigger perfume bottle!	positif

1232	5935558	good value. The perfect summer scent. YSL has done it again. I used to own Black Opium and I loved it. ( I ran out lol) Then I needed a new frangrance...I am a perfume junkie and I shower twice a day and I enjoy being in luxury so I needed something new. I saw this and bought it I also have the lotion for it too. At first you get berries but then omg you get flowers. idk if it is the datura but it is heavenly. I had for two weeks now and my clothes smell good too. It is fresh and clean after a shower I use the lotion and spray this everywhere. Ladies I find that if I spray my tummy at the very top part..my fragrance lasts throughout the day. Give it a try. If you need a summer/Spring scent this is it. I find the Black Opium is a Winter/Fall and I need to replenish that too.	positif
1233	24911721	I always thought that this scent was over-hyped, and in a way it sort of is considering the price point. There are a lot of scents on the market that can be compared to this one, so you're definitely paying for the quality of ingredients (very high) and packaging (beautifully cut glass bottle)...all in all I really like this. It is actually a perfume I crave for pure sweetness but in a non-gourmand way. I do agree with the fragrance's olfactory category- this is indeed an oriental floral. You can smell the floral notes. I can smell sweet orchid, jasmine and sweet rose. They are just so well blended together with the tea and bergamot that you get this unbelievably fresh-sweet accord and you have a trail of patchouli that has been watered down a whole lot underpinning the fragrance. This patchouli is soft and sweet rather than robust as in Chanel's Chance or Coco Mademoiselle. This scent is soft and sweet, and has a chiffon like quality to it. As I spray it on I imagine an aura of pink cloud smoke wafting about me. Nice choice on the packaging colors as well; it reminds of classical ballerina colors- the light pink and black accents. Very chic looking.	positif
1234	23595312	This  fragrance oh my god! I received a sample of this beautiful scent and within a few days it was gone. I could not stop smelling my arm,clothes or anything it had left a hint of smell on. It was love at first smell I have been searching for a Perfume that in bodied me and who I am and here she is in all glory Dior poison girl EDT. it sounds cliche but I had butterflies and I still do whenever I spritz myself. Within the week I bought a full size bottle with no regrets. This fragrance is spicy yet sweet and the bottle itself is gorgeous I love the pink juice inside. I definitely would say this fragrance is not just for young girls as the advertising targets I am in my mid twenties and will proudly call this my signature scent. Projection: 7/10Longevity: 8/10 Price: Not cheap but 100% worth it.	positif
1235	7818249	This is my signature scent. I've tried many different fragrances and nothing else can compare. When I wear this, people always tell me how good I smell and what is it.I typically get this for Christmas from my hubby, but when I purchase on my own I get it from Macy's or Boscov's. I like to layer it with their lotion also, but it's more for a lasting effect as the lotion isn't very moisturizing.I feel it's priced competitively, as it seems all (good) perfumes have gone up in price.If you're on the fence, spray it on your wrists then walk around and do your shopping, smelling every so often. As it merges with your body chemistry the scent will change. It becomes so feminine and soft, but has a definite presence.	positif
1236	15668869	"This perfume is class in a bottle. It opens citrusy, maybe a little too strong for some noses, but if you wait for 10 minutes it turns into a mysterious and feminine fragrance that will make you fall in love with...citrusy notes leave a little to say welcome to a sweet bouquet of roses, narcissus and jasmine that stays on of me for a long time. But my favorite ""season"" of this scent comes after all of that...base notes of this scent are so relaxing....balsamic and a little soapy...patchouli, vanilla and some others...on me it has a pretty long longevity and a moderate/heavy sillage (it depends on how much you spray on) The bottle design is just wow. The most beautiful one I ever seen. Classy and evergreen. Price is the only sad thing about this lovely creature... Ask for a little sample of this and smell it at home with no other perfumes in the air, ready to make you stoned and confused."	positif
1237	16566520	"My skin has a great fixation and with the passage of time is getting a slight but powerful smell.It's a perfume I use at night. I'm loving using it for special occasions to do the ""phyna"", hahaha.I do not agree with some opinions that say it's a scent of voice, actually I detest these labels. I think that being a lady is synonymous with having a story, a long life, something to tell. I pray to God that I have a long life, hahaha.I analyze as a scent for classic and elegant women, my face a little convinced hahaha. Of course, what perfume in general, goes a lot of skin, mood and style.I think it's interesting who is interested in buying a test, so you can see if you like the fragrance. But I say that I loved too much and I do not intend to be without this classic.A kiss loves."	positif
1238	4724391	long lasting, beautiful, fresh, sexy. Wow is all I have to say about this fragrance. Very different and multifaceted. Layer after layer unfolds as it wears on throughout the day. Atelier's description is perfect i.e. sophisticated, succulent, passionate. In my opinion and on my skin it is more of a citrus - earthy scent than floral. I find that I can still smell it later in the day so the longevity of wear is fantastic. Unisex to me goes without saying for any of this perfume house's fragrances - they are each so unique and depending on your skin chemistry and scent preference can work for anyone. One thing I would suggest for anyone trying these colognes is to wear them for at least a day before forming a final opinion. The colognes tend to have multiple layers that reveal themselves as the day goes on.	positif
1239	10951889	"This smell is one of my top favourite perfumes and for good reason; it's intoxicating, feminine, delicate yet bold and sultry. While I'm not particularly a vanilla/sugary scent type of gal, this scent in my opinion is the perfect ""grown up"" vanilla. The sweetness of the vanilla lingers while contrasting with the wood scents, muskiness and hints of citrus/spice. It is one of the most unique perfumes I have ever smelled but I have received countless compliments while wearing it. As well, the staying power of this cologne is amazing; I've previously worn it for a whole night out and the next day the fragrance would still linger on my hair and clothes. It is expensive, as most higher end perfumes are, but it will definitely last you. I can also promise you that you'll want to spray this all over your stuff because it's just that amazing!"	positif
1240	6217003	This is a very beautiful cologne the packaging that it came in was a high quality glass bottle with a very good design to the bottle the fragrance of the cologne is not too strong and not too subtle or sweet smelling it is a warm tone fragrance and you can smell the peppery scent of the pink peppercorns yes you can also smell a subtle sweetness to it but it's more of a warm tone smelling cologne get it's not too strong but the scent last is for very long time in you can smell the luxury in the fragrance this is one of my favorite colognes and something that I would be using over and over again the price point on this bottle of cologne is good for the quality that you receiving you do not have to spray this cologne over and over again the fragrance is that good and I love the fact that they have a a cologne and a perfume great for you and your significant other boht fragrances smell phenomenal I received this cologne for sampling purposes but all the opinions are my own	positif
1241	25768691	Lasts forever Beautiful scent that lasts forever, even after showering as someone else has said. If it's not lasting on you, you need to exchange it. This is the longest lasting perfume I own and I have a very large collection of designer luxury perfumes. Some of my Tom Ford parfums don't have this type of staying power. This is one of the few scents I own that smells VERY different on my skin compared to the test paper. On the paper it pulls very citrusy, and I usually am not a fan of citrus perfume. On me, it pulls more musky and powdery which is my favorite. It's such a beautifully layered perfume that evolves beautifully with wear. After an all day excursion with lots of running around for over 8 hours the scent was still strong on my pulse points, and stayed that way after showering. Highly recommend this beautiful fragrance	positif
1242	3368064	Purchased as a gift for a lady. Some of her previous likes have been Chanel no.5, Dior Poison, and YSL Opium - all quite 'heavy' perfumes - so I picked this one out for her to try, and she loves it - so much so that it seems to have become the new favourite! As a bit of a scent aficionado myself, I'm seriously tempted to buy a bottle for my own use :-)The fragrance itself is bold without being 'loud'; striking but thoroughly elegant. The amber is rich and warm, with up-front resinous woods and vanilla undertones. Herbal notes keep it from being too powdery or cloying. (Be warned though: the initial herbal-spicy impression, unexpected in an amber, might skew your impression of the scent. One must give it a few minutes to 'settle in') To my nose, it isn't too sweet and certainly isn't syrupy. It's long-lasting (over 6 hours) and has strong projection (can be smelled from several metres away). The bottle should last for some time, as a little goes a long way.	positif
1243	5170775	good value. I had stopped wearing perfume until this past year, I could not find one that I really liked until I smelled Gucci Bamboo. I sprayed myself and walked around the mall for 3-4 hours. Upon my return to Sephora I was in love and bought it. I have just purchased my 3rd bottle! It has become my signature scent. After awhile it is a scent that you have to get up close and personal to smell. I personally feel that it is very alluring yet elegant. I love everything about it. This go around I am buying the lotion and shower gel to layer my fragrance. One of the best purchases for me of 2016! Thanks Gucci. Now that I have found this please don't discontinue it (that is what has happened to all of the other fragrances that I loved). The bottle is beautiful and looks lovely displayed on my makeup table.	positif
1244	15241506	I'm a super olfactory-driven girl, so I love smelly-good things. I've been waiting to find my signature scent, and I think this is it! I love edgy but still feminine smells. I currently wear Eau De Gaga and Burberry Brit, depending on the day. I have a feeling those will be neglected from here on out. Gucci Bloom has a porcelain, vintage look to the packaging. Making it feel glamorous and pretty. The scent: Tuberose and jasmine combine with Rangoon Creeper—a unique flower discovered in South India that is being used for the first time in perfumery to create a rich fragrance... is how Gucci plays it on their website. It's definitely floral, but not like 16,000 roses hitting you in the face floral. It's subtle, but still the first out the gate... you know what I mean? Do your nares a favor by sniffing this the next time you're in the store? You won't regret it.	positif
1245	16811871	I recently got a sample of this with my order, and I'm so glad that I did. It's a sweet and dreamy scent, very light, and not cloying at all. I sprayed some on today in the morning, and I can still smell it on me. I know that some people say it's not long-lasting, but gourmand fragrances generally agree with me so that's probably why it works for me. It all depends on body chemistry. It smells very fruity at first, but then I get a lot of vanilla and peach which I really really love. I actually ended up liking this better than the perfume I ordered (which was toooo sweet), so I'm gonna return it and get a big bottle of Saint instead. I think I just found my signature scent so yay! :)	positif
1246	6249037	I absolutely love perfume and was delighted that I was able try this Chloe fragrance. I have never tried or owned a Chloe fragrance before so I was very excited to try it. The packaging is very simple and understated which I like and the bottle is just so elegant. I love the actual design of the bottle and the bow gives it that little touch of sophistication. The fragrance itself is absolutely gorgeous. It's a very classy scent which would be perfect for a bride on her wedding day. I know that I would have if I had discovered it at the time. The scent is just so nice and a little goes a long way. I could still smell it on my wrist the next day. My husband even commented on how nice it was and he said he found it quite sexy which is a nice compliment! My sister and mother have also tried it and they both love it too. I can honestly say that I think this might just be my favourite perfume and I am intrigued to try the other Chloe scents now. I would definitely buy this again and it would also be an ideal gift for a man to buy his special woman xx [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1247	1454014	I received my free bottle of Lacoste natural perfume earlier on last week and decided to put it to a proper test before giving my review. As someone who is extremely fussy about perfume and being somewhat set in my ways I was unsure whether this would cut the mustard so to speak. Well all I can say is I will definitely be trying the other scents as I have completely fallen in love with this one! Its light fresh scent leaves you with a clean, light, cool summer fragrance which lasted all day, which again I didn't think would happen with it being a clean scent. The other perk of this was that other people could smell it and constantly asked what I was wearing which made me beam :)All in all I would definitely recommend this gorgeous perfume and have already done so to friends and work colleagues.

1248	4874707	This smells pretty much like heaven, actually. Tender Romance by Ralph Lauren is slightly floral, a touch of sweetness, and completely airy like summer. When Influenster let me know I was in this campaign to try a new fragrance for review, I was nervous. Completely nervous! I haven't been crazy for a scent since CKOne (every college girl of 1999's favorite) other than Betsey Johnson's Too Pretty. Plus, my husband tends to be super sensitive to fragrances that aren't food or nature. Instead, I received this gorgeous perfume, and I've been wearing it ever since. It reminds me a bit of the peonies growing by the front door, and how delicate but memorably they greet me each day. It has me dreaming of summer days at the lake. My favorite scents are vanilla and amber, and while this is a touch more girly than my normal fragrances, it's really lovely and special. This Ralph Lauren and Influenster box for the win! While the gift was complimentary for purposes of review, I'm not afraid to say when something isn't my thing. All reviews are from my experience and tastes. Enjoy the summer and scent!	positif
1249	5401473	I adore this fragrance! I have about 20 perfumes and this is the only one my husband complemented me on! And in my opinion I have some great perfumes in my collection like Gucci 2 , d & g Rose the one, Roberto cavalli , Lolita Lempicka etc...I only have a sample from Sephora and almost running out so ill keep my eyes open on craigslist for a bottle of this since it's just too expensive ...I cant justify spending that much on a perfume I mean common with tx 160$ that's just stupid! But I love it ambery not too sweet longevity and sillage are just amazing! I love catching wiffs of it during the day vs other perfumes I smell when I first spray then I have to put nose to skin to even smell the faintess scent, nothing irritates me more being a perfume lover! This is also unique...I believe I could recognize this if someone was wearing it cause it's not a generic scent by any means! Just lovely and mature for Marc Jacobs!	positif
1250	17079326	"I received this product complimentary for testing and reviewing purposes from a recent voxbox I received! I was super excited to try a Vera Wang perfume but I was nervous this was going to have that musky ""old lady smell"". I was totally wrong! I received the periwinkle & iris. I'm not usually one for floral scents, but surprisingly I didn't mind it at all. Though I would definitely label it as a floral fragrance, it has that clean, freshness to it. It really is a unique scent. Sweet, warm, floral, very slight citrusy, woodsy scent that seems to blend right in. The fragrance is listed to have notes of: periwinkle, iris, blue jasmine, bergamot, violet petals, benzoin and whipped sugar. This perfume lasted ALL day on me and then some! When I woke up the next morning to take a shower, I could smell it! Very long lasting. Personally for me, this wouldn't be an everyday perfume for me. I will use this for special occasions. Date nights, going out to dinner, holiday parties, etc. Beautiful packaging. I love how Vera Wang has such a variety and wide range of fragrances. (Photo by me)"	positif
1251	5403636	This is a very beautiful fragrance. It's one of the few that you can wear and everyone enjoys, its unoffensive, clean and refreshing. The key is not to overdo it, I know many enjoy showering themselves in perfume, which you can do with this fragrance, however, in doing so it will amplify the fragrance immediately and become a little acidic. Its a simple solution to this, just wait for it to settle down into the skin or use an appropriate amount. It doesn't truly smell like green tea but a mild citrus and overall a 'clean' scent. You can wear this perfume and I guarantee nobody will find it offensive or off-putting only fresh and endearing. Truly a great safe, fresh and clean scent. Overall: great price, value for money, clean and fresh and sleek packaging of which I have repurchased time and time again :)	positif
1252	5076014	good value. I have been on the hunt for a scent that doesn't offend my sensitive nose. Lately, I've been drawn to more spicy scents, which include some targeted towards males. I fell in love with Maison Martin Margiela Replica Jazz Club. Then I tried a sample of JHAS Not a Perfume, and it contains the one underlying note that I find addicting in Jazz Club and in all the spicy fragrances I've sampled. I bought the travel spray size of Not a Perfume right away. The one thing I'm disappointed with is that Not a Perfume isn't stronger, though if I do sniff directly where I sprayed some 5-6 hours later, I can still smell it. If you're out for the evening, you may want to freshen up the scent. I'm just happy to have found a keeper!	positif
1253	4734583	good value. I love my discovery kit. I was allergic to Gentlewoman and I didn't like Mad Madame, but I liked all the rest. Oh, I haven't yet tried Miss Charming. The rest I really enjoy, especially Lady Vengeance which has a rose smell that isn't sickly sweet. Not A Perfume is also a favorite. I'm not afraid to wear it around other people, because it's not a heavy fragrance even though it still has a distinctive scent. It's a clean, freshly-washed kind of scent. The two downsides: The perfume samples don't aren't travel-freindly because they don't have caps. The other thing is that the scents don't have much longevity. It requires frequent reapplication. I'd have to think about buying a full-sized perfume given the cost. I don't mind spending $15, but for $200 I'd like something that won't get used up in reapplications.	positif
1254	18493120	If I could give this fragrance 100 stars, I would! I consider myself to be somewhat of a perfume connoisseur and have amassed quite a collection... That being said, I was still in search of my scent. However, once I sampled Not A Perfume, my search was over - this fragrance is such a beautiful combination of clean and warm! It's delicate but not so light that it dissipates quickly. It's a difficult fragrance to describe! I received several compliments on this perfume and the comments ranged from pleasantly clean/soapy to elegant. My fiance commented that it smells like you, only perfume-y. I would rate the sillage level as soft to moderate; others noticed my perfume but weren't left in a wake of fragrance. I sprayed the fragrance, (in my hair and on my collarbone) at 6am and it was still noticeable at 2pm. I did reapply the perfume around 6pm before heading out to dinner and the scent stayed with me throughout the evening.	positif
1255	20290413	I love this set. I'm not into feminine perfumes, but these lack the ultra-sweet, fruity, and floral notes that turn me off of most scents marketed to women. These are androgynous enough that they could be men's, but they're not exactly masculine. A few of them are spicy and playful, a couple are dark and mysterious. This is a truly unique scent palette that manages to be truly different from other collections that offer androgynous scents like the Commodity and Atelier fragrances. These smell expensive and last all day. My favorites are definitely Gentlewoman and Mad Madame, two of the darker, more complex scent profiles that flirt with being masculine without crossing that line. I have gifted this set because I knew it would be a winner. The price is very reasonable for such an exciting variety. I absolutely love the insert that explains the ingredients which define the base and top notes. It helps me to be able to understand what constitutes the fragrances which most appeal to me.	positif
1256	18492434	I really like this foundation although I do have a few critiques for it. First off, the packaging is terrible. It's plastic and feels really cheap. For $40 I expect a glass bottle and more luxurious packaging. It's not a deal breaker but just really tacky IMO. Secondly, the scent is just too much. I have no idea who thought it would be a good idea to heavily scent the foundation. I thought people were exaggerating about the smell but it is sooo strong. It smells like a really really strong perfume. If you have adverse reactions to fragrance, you will not like this. Lucky for me, this isn't a deal breaker because the foundation itself is beautiful. Very full coverage and beautiful on the skin. Moisturize well if you have dry skin. The shade Toffee was absolutely perfect for my skin tone.	negatif
1257	19665544	Fun and Flirty-with-a-Purpose I received a complimentary sample of this through Influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. It smells incredibly light and fresh yet complex - It’s intriguing. One of those scents you keep trying to lean in and get another whiff of to figure out what you’re smelling. And that’s exactly the effect you want in a perfume, isn’t it? It’s smells a bit citrusy, sweet, like amber, and lightly floral. The citrus fades after a couple of hours, but the floral lingers all day making it perfect for day-to-night. The scent is fun, but not so fun that it can’t be taken seriously. Wear it for anything, really. The scent is unique without being offensive too. Overall, it’s a really fun, flirty-with-purpose, “I do what I want” sort of fragrance. If that’s you, you’ll love this!	positif
1258	19665560	Good for the fragrance sensitive; high quality! FIrst of all, I have to say that overall, as I've gotten older, I've become more and more fragrance-sensitive. Cheap, highly artificial perfumes and colognes now give me at minimum, a headache; at worst, can make my skin itch and get hives. Marc Jacobs is one of the FEW brands that I can rely on to have high quality ingredients that smell great and give me no negative reaction! Now for the review of Decadence itself. I tend to be a fan of less conventional scents and I liked that this one wasn't overly sweet and floral scented. In addition, it was super long lasting. The three times I tried it, twice before going to work and once before going out with friends, it was at least 5 or 6 hours until the scent faded from my wrists. I also liked the cute packaging shaped like a purse. I do wish it had a spray applicator, but that may be because the sample I received was smaller and fewer ounces, I think the larger sizes probably have an actual applicator. Overall, definitely would recommend this and other MJ fragrances for my fellow sensitive brethren who still want to spritz a little scent once in awhile!	positif
1259	15245225	This is my signature fragrance! I searched for over a year, trying a variety of perfumes to find my signature. Then, I found Alien. Everything from the packaging to the scent is perfection. People always compliment me on this scent and ask what I'm wearing but I NEVER tell anyone. I even go so far as to hide my bottle when I'm traveling with friends! It's so delicious I spray it again every night before I go to sleep and I'm dying to buy the matching candles. However, I will say, one of my friends became OBSESSED with finding out what perfume I wear (for over a year). She FINALLY figured it out when she met someone else wearing it. When my friend tried it on herself, she hated it! It really does smell different on everyone.	positif
1260	15301077	I have seen the recent advert for this fragrance featuring Kate Moss and was interested in trying it. Upon opening it I thought the bottle looked appealing and would actually be really convenient for slipping into my handbag to carry around with me. I found the fragrance to be floral, fruity and fresh and quite feminine at first. A few hours later however it seemed to have a more musky smell and I thought it was less feminine, possibly unisex. It was nice that it seemed to contain a combination of a few smells than complimented each other rather than one flat scent. The smell seemed to last about 5 hours then it had worn off and I had to reapply the perfume. I will definitely wear this perfume again, my husband commented that he liked the scent when I wore it. I think the price seems very reasonable for a good quality perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1261	15585576	The house of Balmain produces a heavenly fragrance in a wonderful art deco bottle. I love wearing Ambre Gris all the time. It's just silky smooth perfection and I love how there is nothing jarring in this composition for me. A very comforting, calming and well-blended perfume. This very sensual and sophisticated fragrance smells so good on me that it is like wearing a second skin. At times it's a tiny bit spicy, a tiny bit sweet or a tiny bit salty, which I think adds to an alluring and mysterious aura. On my skin, Ambre Gris begins warm and creamy at first, which is mostly the warm amber and sweet tuberose peppered with an occasional salty accord, before it settles into the most beautiful resinous scent that's utterly addicting... Sillage is soft (it's very much a skin scent); and longevity is at least 8-9 hours.	positif
1262	1151815	I developed severe scent allergies when I quit smoking. It's not only perfume it's all kinds of odors like fragrance candles and detergents, gasoline and other fumes. I almost gave up wearing any kind of perfume or scent which was sad because I always wore. Lately I've been buying small sample vials from eBay to try and test different smells to see if they give me severe sinus headaches or not. I came across Calvin Klein's Euphoria and absolutely fell in love with it. Since joining scentbird it is now my first fragrance on order coming next month and I cannot wait! It is bright and wakes you up when you first Spritz it but then it dries down into something very mysterious and powdery and soft. I like perfumes that have to be reapplied a couple of times a day because if they stick around too long I may get sick from them. This one is perfect and it fits the bill. I'm not saying it's going to be great for everyone who has fragrance sensitivities but for me it's a keeper!	positif
1263	13035324	Love! Love! Love! This perfume is one of my new favorite scents! This is a beautiful scent and I've gotten several compliments while wearing it. Black Opium smells best on me after I took a good bubble bath (although I take good baths everyday). No matter who gets close to me they always say, wow, you smell good. The fragrance lasts all day too. This perfume is pure deliciousness. It's got a scent you won't forget. It's similar to Victoria's Secret's Noir Tease - but more grown up and less chemical smelling. I love the coffee-kick opening notes, mingling with my favorite orange blossom, softening to a creamy-floral with a whisper of vanilla - encased in a stunning sparkle black bottle. This is the 4th fragrance I have ever come across that I can picture wearing any time of day, any season for any occasion. Absolutely love it! Need I say anything more.....	positif
1264	4745941	travel-friendly. I am a big fan of the replica scents and I see why they chose lazy sunday and beach walk for the roller balls (now just make tea escape, and i will be happy.) Good way to try out the fragrance for a bit, and right in price point line with the other lines in the roller ball size. Not all Sephoras carry this line, which I learned the hard way. Scent itself is clean, light, and lasts quite a while. Not sure what the complaints about it not lasting are about. This is especially true if i put a roll or two through my hair. I can smell it lingering the next day when i do that, and i love it. I am sensitive to smells, and not in the I claim to be sensitive to smells to feel special sort of way. I sneeze at many perfumes and dread walking through a department store because my eyes get itchy if they try to attack me. this scent doesn't bother me at all.	positif
1265	4804185	I received a sample of this in my last order (requested it) and was skeptical going in as I am generally not a fan of coconut smells in perfume, and testing it on the paper in the store I was underwhelmed. But I put it on this week and wow, I was instantly transported to summer at the lake, swimming, fishing, memories of all the times camping there! It was amazing! This perfume does have quite a sunscreen/mildly coconut scent to it (think Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen but less potent), along with a saltiness, and when it mixed with my skin it was just like sunscreen summers at the lake. So I did enjoy the experience, but not sure if smelling like that is what I want in a fragrance..not an everyday scent, but nice when I want to remember good summer days. Might purchase a small size one day, but for now I'm happy with just the sample.	positif
1266	11271165	I received a sample of this perfume, from a friend from Paris, with a few gifts for Christmas and I've been hooked ever since. This is the best smelling perfume I've ever tried and I try a lot of fragrances. I like Tori Burch and used to wear Armani diamonds and sometimes I wear Gucci but this blows all of them out of the water. However, it is expensive so unfortunately to get a full bottle, it would need it to be a gift lol and Guerlain doesn't do roll-ons either so you have to buy the full bottle. It has a more intense scent, like a barely there feminine musk. Not a fruity or flowery smell; at least for the regular one. They do have other versions but the original is the best. It's a very unique scent. I get stopped in the store whenever I wear a sample and people ask what I'm wearing. Overall I love this perfume and I plan on begging for it for Christmas lol.	positif
1267	6095659	I really love this perfume, in spite of it being a little different than what I normally go for. It does smell very much like the entirety of the 1980s to me, as it probably does for most people that are near my age. When I was about nine or ten, my grandma found a miniature bottle of Poison somewhere and gave it to me. I remember taking it outside and hiding with it so I could smell it in private, and I felt like I'd just been given something very special. I was completely taken by the scent, even though it smelled strong and grown-up. I don't know what became of this bottle, but I probably bathed myself in this adult lady perfume until it was gone. Now, as an adult, I own some, and I don't wear it often just because I find it to be very assertive, but I still like having it at my disposal to wear when I feel like it. I love the bottle, it is beautiful and iconic just like the scent that it contains. I am sure that a lot of people hate this as much as I love it because it declares its presence so vocally, but I like having this almost-brash but still very pretty and feminine fragrance around.	positif
1268	5417734	I go through phases of loving the original J'adore .I feel it is somewhat weaker than the original Calice Becker formulation .However , the Absolu version I believe by Demarchy is truly a 5 star fragrance.I will say my bottle dates back to 2009 and knowing the history of reformulation in regards to Dior... I do not know how much the scent has changed in 2017 .The scent I have is rich ,golden in color and golden in smell. Longevity is fantastic. It is in no way an anemic perfume lacking in body or notes. All the notes of J'adore are amplified - more jasmine , more ylang .. maybe tuberose in it ? All together in the Absolu - it is literally a symphony. Absolutely stunning.if you have prblems with the EDP version of J'adore and need something more full bodied I suggest1.J'adore Absolu 2.J'adore Touche de Parfum ( the new oil based version - which is also very very good )	positif
1269	24724027	Gabrielle Chanel is the newest fragrance within the Chanel family in 15 years. Not only is the bottle stunning it smells even prettier than it looks. The way in which the thin glass bottle has been made is really unique, and super tiny. I absolutely love how the blend of the classic Chanel perfume bottle and the new design creates a modern touch. It totally reflects the young modern women who would wear it. Even down to the tiniest of details, I really like how the liquid inside moves weightlessly around and shows visible bubbles, again, showcasing the modern element to the design.As for the scent, the overall fragrance is a true floral consisting of four white flowers. The ultra-feminine scent settles beautifully on the skin and isn’t overly heavy. After the initial floral smell, you start to detect notes of sandalwood and deep blackcurrant. I think this is perfect day or night, very much the older sister to Coco Mademoiselle it is crisp yet stunningly sophisticated. I think if you are a fan of Coco Mademoiselle than this is definitely up your street.CHANEL Gabrielle Chanel, Eau De Parfum Spray	positif
1270	4948974	I received a sample of this perfume with my Play by Sephora subscription box. Normally, I don't pay much attention to the perfume samples, partially because I'm so excited with the other products, and partially because I very rarely find a perfume better than my usual go-to perfume. My favorite perfume of all time is Estée Lauder's Pleasures. It has a light floral scent that works well with my body chemistry. When I first saw that this perfume was scented with oranges, I was sure I wouldn't care for it, as citrus smells just aren't my thing. However, one day I decided to try it and I've been addicted ever since. Yes, it does have a strong citrus scent, but it's blended so well with other fragrances that it's absolutely intoxicating! If you're unsure whether you'll like it, I encourage you to try a sample. I was pleasantly surprised by this one!	positif
1271	16240354	I have owned the white musk EDT and the perfume oil since a long time, yet I don't find myself reaching for them too often, since I prefer gourmand-fruity-floral fragrances. Yet, one day in the store, the sleek, beautiful bottle of this shower gel caught my eyes, and I sniffed it and boy, did I love it! I thought it was the the perfect fragrance for the shower. it smelled so clean and comforting! So I ended up buying the bottle of this shower gel with a matching lilac bath lily (so much to please the eyes lol) and I must say that I've fallen in love with this stuff! It is such a pleasant change from the usual fruity shower gels I've been using recently (also by TBS) This shower gel feels so silky and it simply cocoons your skin with its velvety, comforting fragrance. And even after the shower, the fragrance remains on your skin, more like a skin scent, but it doesn't linger a lot, which is fine by me. I'll definitely repurchase it when I run out.. and I might as well give the iconic musk more attention, the scent has kind of grown on me!	positif
1272	7857847	"I have been wanting to try this & found a small bottle at my local Walmart for $2.97. I bought the blush pink one. I appreciate the smell as some dry shampoo's are horrible & when I have sprayed the others people have commented on the stench. This one has a nice, light scent that lasts awhile. (I actually had gone out and forgot to put on perfume, but kept smelling this floral fragrance and kept wondering ""what is that?"" Until I realized it was my hair lol. It works really great when I don't want to wash my hair. I tend to get a very dry, itchy scalp if I wash too much & also if I wait too long between washes. This is very nice on those in between days! Highly recommend, especially if you like a nice scent as opposed to an aerosol smell. I gave 4 stars because even on my blond hair, I sometimes get white spots (which may be user error!), but it easily disappears if I just tousle with my fingers."	positif
1273	23699872	his is such an amazing fragrance. It is very a light scent with hints of sweetness and fruitiness to it while still remaining a fresh scent. I received a sample from a department store and fell in love right away. It was similar enough to my usual perfumes that I was attracted to it, but different enough to really stand out in my collection. When I do not feel like smelling like a fruit salad, I put this on. It puts me in a better mood. I have the rollerball and am trying to make it stretch. It is a pretty pricey perfume, but I can understand the price. It is an amazing product that lasts all day. It is unique. It is Armani. There was no way this thing was going to be cheap. I feel like the price wouldn't really deter me from getting it in the future, nor should it deter anyone else. I switch up scents often, however, so I stick with rollerball	positif
1274	16687499	Laura Mercier is hands down one of my favorite luxury body care brands, and I think their products are worth every penny!This hand cream is one of my favorite products out of the line, and the scent Creme Brulee is also one of my top 2 fragrances in the line!It smells good enough to eat, it is so smooth and creamy, and the moisturizing properties last sooooo long. I don't need to reapply this over and over again, I just need this a couple of times a day and my hands are soft and smooth.I get compliments when I have this on my hands all day long, and I won't even need perfume when I have this one!The scent is a grown up, beautiful caramelized vanilla. It literally makes me want to eat it lol.If you love foody/gourmand vanilla scents, you will adore this one!If you hate these types of scents, I would probably avoid the skin care line from Laura Mercier, because they are all a bit gourmand and makes you want to eat them. 	positif
1275	23017658	"The packaging itself did not impress me, but when I checked the scent I could not forget about it and decided that I must have these perfumes!! A fresh floral and light fragrance mixed with warm musk and sandalwood reminds me of the smell of the coming spring, a light breeze when everything wakes up to life. I am charmed by the lightness of this perfume and at the same time so durable. Everyone who smells this fragrance will pay attention to us. My daughter told me today morning : ""Mommy you smel so lovely..."" , so what you can add more if the child can feel it? I can say: If you want feel young, light and happy you have to get Gucci Bloom Acqua Di Fiori-a breath of spring and a fresh scent of blooming flowers!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"	positif
1276	10558404	Upon first spritz (which I am discovering is fairly accurate assessment of a fragrance for me), I thought powdery floral with a definitive perfume smell. It was only a bit after that I detected this softness and freshness from this perfume which I couldn't put my finger on until I looked at the notes. There is neroli (a citrus) and papaya which lends it the freshness and sweetness but they are in back with the white florals in the forefront of this scent.This isn't a light fragrance nor a heavy one either. It is somewhere in-between. It carries so people will know you have something on but it will not bother anyone or you. There is a young maturity to it a bit like a young woman wise beyond her years. It is definitely a feminine scent.It is an all season and all occasion type of fragrance.	positif
1277	18453798	At first sniff this perfume had me immediately hooked. It has such a soft, sweet, sexy smell that makes you feel like a strong powerful woman. It's not a fragrance that would be considered too old smelling or too young smelling for anyone, it is extremely versatile. I do prefer this fragrance as a night out fragrance, but would not hesitate to wear it during the day either. Once on the body, the fragrance changes slightly to become a warm sensual scent (which differs from it's scent on paper). The bottle is beyond gorgeous. I'm wearing it currently, so I can't say the exact staying power yet, but I have a feeling it will last awhile. This is one of my favorite perfumes that has come out in a long time. It is in my area Sephora stores at the moment, so I am currently using the free sample, and encourage others to go try it out.	positif
1278	22694599	I would love to rate this with 5 stars but sadly, I cannot due to the complete lack of staying power. The fragrance makes my heart soar. I wish there were a way to make this last! It is the perfect clean, soap and water with light white musk scent - not too perfumey and no harsh notes. It just smells like you have been lounging in a luxurious bubble bath all morning and then slipped into some fresh linens. I put this on at 9am and by noon it is completely gone. Like not even a trace remains. When I walk by other women and catch a faint scent of their fragrances, I am jealous. I want my fragrance to last all day, too - or at least more than a couple of hours.I tried to make this work by carrying it around with me. It is too much maintenance having to respray so often, and I went through a bottle like water.One reviewer below had an excellent tip to spray on clothing rather than skin. I doused one of my scarves in it and it it did hold the fragrance better. So that will work if you are determined to wear this for a night out, but I wish I could just wear the fragrance on my skin.	positif
1279	22664335	I've been using Lavanilla for years but found it didn't last all day, or even a half day if I was really active. I love Tarte products and decided to give clean queen a try. I Love this deodorant ! It does go on white, which I like because I see if I missed a spot, and the it goes clear. I don't get deodorant marks on, or stains in my clothes . It Lasts ALL day. I've never had it fail and I can get really sweaty. The fragrance put me off at first, not because it smelled bad, just because I'm not used to a strong scent. Good news is the scent is barely noticeable after about 1/2 hour. So if you wear perfume or scented body lotion it shouldn't be a problem. I highly recommend it .	positif
1280	16777816	I should start by saying that I wore this scent religiously (no pun intended) years ago when it first came out. It's one of only two perfumes I constantly repurchase (the other being Armani Code). When it was discontinued, my heart just broke! Couldn't even find a premium purchase online elsewhere, so when she brought it back you can imagine my excitement. This scent is just as magical as years before. You WILL get stopped and complimented on how good you smell - in my experience mostly by men ;) It's woody, but not to earthy, and the after notes are the perfect sensual/sweet mix. My only complaint would be that it doesn't seem to last as long as my other high end perfumes. If a lotion was released to compliment both fragrances, I'd be all over that! So glad my staple is back in stores.	positif
1281	4666372	I used to wear this fragrance years ago and I've fallen in love with it all over again. I like the rose along with citrus, its a clean floral. Ladylike without being fussy. There are perfumes out there who also have floral/rose top notes but come off cloying or granny-like, but I don't get that with Stella. Most important may be that it doesn't give me headache or migraine. I purchased the travel spray (formerly rollerball). The glass is thicker and seems more durable than before, and as a spray it seems more hygienic. But I do think you could control application more with the rollerball. And apparently the formulation was changed a couple of years ago but it's unnoticeable to me. If anything It smells better than ever but that could just be me happy I found this scent again. I will be purchasing the spray/lotion set next so I can layer the scent.	positif
1282	5064897	Rose has not been my thing since the 70s when I wore the original Perfumer's Workshop Tea Rose before entering my 40 year Chanel obsession. However I have found myself drawn to rose scents over the past year. I got a deluxe sample of this and I have fallen in love with it over the past few months. The rose smells like my grandma's garden after a rain and not like a funeral parlor as so many rose scents do to me. The amber in the drydown makes this smell sophisticated and a little sexy. I'd say this is closer to a skin scent after the first hour or so which is how I like my perfume. I am not a fan of fragrance announcing itself to the public or leaving a vapor trail so if you want monster sillage this is not for you. The scent lasted a!! day on me.	positif
1283	16081025	I first smelled this as a sample from Sephora. I didn't read any prior reviews and went into it without any expectations. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This is the nicest rose perfume I've ever tried. I don't like most rose perfumes as they're too grandmother-y, but this is a very feminine rose that is workplace safe/inoffensive. I've very picky about longevity and I was happy with the longevity of this, ESPECIALLY in the hair. I would buy this just to wear in my hair to be honest. The sillage (projection of a fragrance) was good as well. It's not a super complex scent, but that's perfectly okay with me. -1 star for the price per ounce, it just seems a bit high in my opinion. Overall, it's a nice, fresh scent for spring/summer.	positif
1284	20167814	This is now one of my favourites, the smell is just delightful. This fragrance is one you could either love or hate but I personally fell in love with it. Now I'm not really into floral fragrance but this one is different it's like a dark floral woody scent. To me this scent is more of an evening perfume because of how strong smelling it is. While this perfume is quite expensive at £54 for a 30ml this is going to last for a very, very long time as all you need is a spritz. I definitely recommend this perfume and if you haven't smelt it before, you seriously need to then you'll know just how beautiful it is. The bottle the perfume is in is just stunning, it's a deep purple colour with plastic gold sections. It would be more luxurious if the plastic was changed for metal.	positif
1285	6069109	This is the first ever perfume I bought after taking the fragrance IQ. After I took the test, few of the results are perfumes I already own, so I thought the accuracy of the fragrance IQ was on point. I took the leap and bought the Balenciaga FloraBotanica online with no idea how it would smell. When it came in the mail- I freakin’ loved it! I only spray one on my wrist and the longevity is amazing… I do two or three sprays on nights out but for everyday, one is enough especially if you work in an office. My SO loved the scent without me even asking him what he thinks--- so that is a plus! Very subtle, and mid-day, when I am feeling like I am hitting a slump at work, I catch a whiff of this scent and it just takes me to a happy place.	positif
1286	15698038	This fragrance is perfect. I am a lover of perfumes and I had so many different scents and I love when the bottles are fun and different it makes them look beautiful displayed on my vanity together. I always connect scents with times in my life and when I smell it it brings me back to that time. This fragrance to me is so beautiful and classic. I wear this to work and and I enjoy my job so so much as a make up artist I receive compliments on this scent from clients all the time, they always ask what I'm wearing and where I got it lol. I bought this from Macy's when I was at my local mall I stopped into Macy's to pick up a few Lancome items and this was displayed at the counter across from the make up and i was drawn into the design and once I smelled it I knew I had to have it to add to my collection. It is the perfect everyday scent it's not fruity and makes you think your back in middle school or your daughter would steal it when she's running around the house playing dress up.	positif
1287	18442350	Personally the scent of the fragrance is not one that suits my taste or skin. That being said, it does not mean that the smell is bad. I worked in a fragrance shop for over a year, and perfumes react differently to the oils on people's skin. So it will smell different on me than it will on someone else. I gave some to my mother and it suited her much more. (I tend to go for sweeter, fruitier scents) The perfume is strong smelling with Woody, citrusy notes. The actual scent lingers on the skin for a lot longer than the perfumes I usually buy, which is a really good selling point, as I hate that I can't usually smell my perfume for that long. As the title says, it doesn't last an eternity, but it does last a while! I put it on before work and could still smell it after about 4-5 hours, even though I work in a busy restaurant. Over all I would say it's a great perfume but with a slightly older target audience as I thought it smelled too 'old' for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
1288	4802374	I absolutely LOVE how this perfume smells! I've been a fan of the original Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance for years, so I was a bit nervous that this iteration wouldn't possibly be able to compete with it, and I wasn't really sure what to expect. I received a sample of Tender Romance for free from Influenster and loved the scent so much that I am purchasing my own full-sized bottle! Tender Romance is a light, sweet take on the original Romance fragrance...while they both smell dreamy, they really aren't very similar at all. Tender Romance is a bit brighter and more youthful. It's sweet and happy and fruity whereas the classic Romance is more sophisticated and mellow. Tender Romance is a great everyday scent for me - the perfect combination of floral/fruit/light musk...definitely a romantic vibe.	positif
1289	10540617	[I received this complimentary sample from Influenster in the Oasis Voxbox for testing purposes only.]I really enjoy this scent; it smells powdery yet sweet and floral. My SO also loved this fragrance and felt it could double as a men's cologne. It is classic yet refreshing. I love the refined packaging and easy spray top; even the samples were packaged with care. Great summer or spring perfume. Recommended for a date night or maybe a night out as it is sexy and intoxicating. The duration of the scent is not long lasting (I sprayed it on my neck, wrists, and inner arm so that I might get a few fragrance bursts if I began to perspire, it seemed to wear off after a few hours which is understandable) and it is not strong but that's a good thing, it makes it build-able. Love it!!! Thank you Influenster!!!	positif
1290	10541061	 The design of the bottle is adorable in the shape of a heart adorned with a crown. The fragrance I can describe as being fruity, floral, amber woodsy. I don't think this has any musk. My mother who is in her 60's wears a lot of musky perfumes and this is so not a musk. I can smell the apricot, the tangerine and something orange, not entirely citric, probably the pairing of mimosa and orange blossom. This is a perfume with little power it's a soft scent and probably lasted about 2 hours but I wasn't keeping track of time. It's sold as an adult fragrance but the design of the bottle and the scent itself is really youthful, like it's actually a perfume a mom AND her under-18 daughter can both wear. This is a dreamy delicate perfume that I have loved for a long time. I recommend this perfume for women who are young at heart. 	positif
1291	5849980	I purchased Wonderstruck after being very impressed by Wonderstruck Enchanted, and while this fragrance is different it is still just as lovely. Wonderstruck opens with a hit of raspberry, blackberry and tea, with vanilla and peach mixing with the top notes after a few minutes. As the perfume begins to fade, the peach scent remains on the skin until the fragrance disappears completely. The peach smells very fresh and sweet, not at all synthetic and I love that it is the final note of the fragrance. This scent lingers on the skin for about 7 hours, and lasts even longer on fabric and hair. This is a very sweet and girly fragrance, it may not be particularly unique but it is a very enjoyable fragrance. It smells lovely and I get many compliments when wearing it. I would recommend this for anyone to wear, and is perfect for warmer days. I would highly recommend this perfume.Top Notes: Freesia, Tea, Blackberry, Raspberry, Apple Blossom.Heart Notes: Vanilla, Honeysuckle, Hibiscus.Base Notes: Musk, Sandalwood, Amber, Peach.	positif
1292	25587090	"How did I live this long without having a signature scent? I have dabbled in fragrances all my life, but never found one that I would call my own. I'm kinda jealous of women who when you smell a perfume you think of them! So I one of the things I promised myself is that I am going to try a lot of perfumes this year and find ones I love. So far I have bought 5, and this one is a doozy, suzy. I found Ciarra in the 2.3 ounce bottle at 100% strength on Amazon for around $8.00 ($23 at my local Walmart for the same size bottle at 80% strength) so I thought no big deal if I didn't like it! It's like nothing I have ever smelled. It's enchanting! It's a heavy scent so I don't know if it's something I can handle everyday, and I don't know if it will be ""the one"" for me, but I'm so glad I bought it !!!"	positif
1293	5083771	This is my kind of perfume. It's feels like a modern version of an old school femme fatale perfume. I immediately smell juicy black current or other tart berry and bright fresh rose. Under those bright fresh top notes though is a dirty sexy something that I don't know how to describe except not freshly showered but more or less clean body scent. Most fragrance evaporates on me 1-3hrs tops. This last about 5. Once it dries down the scent stays close to your skin so no problem wearing it in an office as long as you don't apply right before you walk in. The only other JHAG fragrance that feels like this one is maybe Another Oud. All of the others are much more lady like so don't assume you'll like Mad Madam because you like Miss Charming or Lady Vengeance.	positif
1294	5058296	I've been looking for a signature scent for 4 years now since I've stepped into the world of cosmetics. I've gone from DKNY's Be Delicious to Marc Jacob's Daisy to Thierry Mugler's Angel and Alien to Chloe. I've tried Dior's Hypnotic Poison and Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb but had to return those because it smelled so bad on my skin (smelled like burnt car tires and spicy sweat, respectively). But this fragrance is so unique and smells so good on my skin that I get random people stopping to ask me what I'm wearing. There's no way to describe it other than it smells so fresh, elegant and awesome. I tried to get one of my friends to describe the smell but all she could come up with subtle, but very good smell. Eloquent, right? But seriously. This perfume not a perfume is amazing and I'm so glad I've finally found my signature scent. Yay!	positif
1295	4962148	good value, subtle scent, acne-clearing. I've been using these bars daily for a week and have already noticed a major improvement in my skin. My skin is so good since using these bars that I don't feel the need to wear any foundation or BB cream. Not only have my under-the-skin bumps disappeared but no new pimples have emerged, and my skin tone looks much more even.Many face washes are too drying for my skin to the point that my face will feel itchy after cleansing, however these bars leave my face feeling squeaky-clean but not tight and irritated. The scent of the bars is very subtle and earthy, not perfume-like. I think people who are sensitive to scents would be fine to use this product. My mom gets intense migraines from fragrances but she was fine after smelling these.If you're considering purchasing this product I think it's absolutely worth trying. I tried this on a whim and am in love with it, and will 100% repurchase once it runs out.	positif
1296	4897422	I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day and it was a huge hit! I didn't have much to go off of - I don't live at home anymore so I don't really know what scents she's into and I didn't want to ask since that would give away the surprise. I am a huge fan of Marc Jacobs fragrances (Daisy is my HG, signature scent) and I figured I couldn't go wrong with his new Splash scents. I was immediately drawn to the cucumber scent - it does definitely smell like cucumber, but is SO nice! It's so light and delicate and perfect for spring and summer. I love it so much that I am having a really hard time telling myself I don't need any more perfume. This will definitely be my next fragrance purchase!	positif
1297	15301387	I'll be honest I have my favourite fragrances and would say I don't often veer from them so I was excited to try something new! I was not disappointed with BOSS The Scent Intense for Her, it smells lovely. Light, fruity, summery aroma. It has become my new fragrance of choice for during the day. The bottle is a beautiful art deco styling and looks fabulous on my dressing table, when its not in my handbag! My only issue is the name, the fragrance just does not last as I was expecting for something labelled as an intense scent. It lasts for maybe four hours and then I have to reapply which is surprise of a eau de parfum, but I just pop it in my handbag and problem solved. All in all a lovely perfume, that I would get again.

1298	17692992	"My Signature Scent That always has everyone asking ""Mmm what's smells so good!?"" This is my all time favorite Bath & Body Works Scent ever! Unfortunately it's a Holiday Only Collection Fragrance available at all B&BW Only during the Holiday Season (Nov-Jan.) Never mind that because as soon as it available every year I go crazy and purchase over 8-10 Fragrance Body Most, Lotions, Body Wash, Glosses, Pocket Bacs, Candles and anything else they launch in Vanilla Bean Noel. It is the perfect seasonal fragrance and honestly the perfect fragrance for any and all time, this is like my classic go to fragrance daily! No matter what Perfume I layer on top, I always always have a under layer of Vanilla Bean Noel that just sweetens up everything. It's the best! Bath & Body Works Vanilla Bean Noel"	positif

1303	5402378	The main notes in this fragrance are jasmine, Mandarin orange, seawater, and sand. In my opinion, it isn't a dead ringer for Coppertone. You can smell the sunblock, but the floral and citrus notes give it a bit of elegance. You can purchase this online or at Sephora and it retails for $74 and comes in only one size, which is 1.7 fluid ounces. It also comes in a rollerball form that retails for $25. It was not on the fragrance wall when I visited Sephora, but it was on the Bobbi Brown shelf. One whiff and I was hooked. I feel personally compelled by this scent...there was a time in my life where I lived in Virginia. My parents often took us to the beach for vacation...we would go to Delaware a lot, sometimes Maryland. We then moved to Georgia where we did manage to go to Florida plenty of times. We stopped going on trips together, so we are never whole as a family anymore. I love this scent because it reminds of those times...we would sit and talk together under an umbrella or when all of us tired kids would pile up into the SUV and my sister would fall asleep on my shoulder. It reminds me of the salty breezes we would breathe in all while trying to build a crappy sandcastle. It reminds me of the smell of my skin after a shower, but after a day at the beach. It smelled faintly of sunblock and Herbal Essences shampoo. I would then climb into bed and feel waves rock me to sleep. I feel surges of happiness when I smell this and it takes me back in time. I have never felt as emotional with any other fragrance as I do with this one. There are a few complaints I have for it...this perfume doesn't last long enough. The scent fades to nothingness after a few hours, so I find the price point to be too high for something with little longevity. I also wish that it came in bigger sizes because I feel like I am going through this bottle quickly. This is also made with synthetic oils, but that isn't really a problem for me. It might be to others who are fond of natural oils and ingredients. Some people think that this smells like Fire Island Bond No 9 and At the Beach 1966. Fire Island is warmer with musk, whereas At the Beach has the top note as marine. People who like this scent also like Estee Lauder's Bronze Goddess, but I am not a fan of that scent at all. Overall, I really love Bobbi Brown Beach, but if I could find something similar with staying power, I would try it out.	positif

1306	7838914	This is a strong scent so use it sparingly but it is a very nice smell. I would describe it as more of a night time, sexy, sultry scent. I got this perfume as a gift from my boyfriend and I wouldn't usually buy a scent this strong but it has quickly become my favorite scent. I usually go for very light flowery scents and while it still has a flowery scent it is a darker stronger scent. I really love the bottle it comes in it really compliments the scent. It is sturdy and strong but is also covered in black glitter. The scent lasts all day long through whatever you are doing.	positif

1561	14077474	I love this scent! It is a mature sweet scent. Not too sweet with a slight musk. I was looking for a new fragrance I had never tried that would leave me smelling like a candy or cookie and this one stood out! Not a summer scent in my opinion but great for fall/winter. I use it as an every day scent.	positif

1572	11786439	LOVE THIS SCENT!!!! I have been wearing this scent for years and was upset when they stopped selling it in the stores. A lot of perfumes don't last long on me for some reason but this is one of the two perfumes that actually holds it's scent on me and I ALWAYS get told I smell good when I wear this. I'd say it's my signature scent.	positif

1577	25769434	lasts all day This scent is soooo beautiful! It makes me think of a tropical resort. It’s very light and has a powdery scent, but stays all day on the skin. I sprayed on my wrist and the smell lasted for hours! I first discovered this scent because I own the soleil blanc shimmering body oil. I loved it but I wanted the scent to last longer so this perfume is the perfect solution	positif

1594	9235207	Love this scent. It is nice and light and doesn't have a strong perfume smell.	positif
1595	11031239	This is my favorite scent during the winter time. I absolutely love that woody scent it gives off. I was so obsessed with the scent that I even found a perfume that smells quite similar to this. It is called White by Kenneth cole, so if you are considering a perfume in the similar scent range. Check it out.	positif
1596	11359008	I love this scent. It smells like apples and lavender. It comes in lotion and perfume.	positif
1597	23461273	A Thousand Wishes is my favourite scent from Bath & Body Works. Their fragrance mist gives the perfect amount of scent without being over powering and the scent lasts. This is a very affordable perfume, valuing at rough $12.50 for a bottle. The bottle itself is pretty, and matches the scent perfectly - upscale and pretty!	positif
1598	23453626	Fantastically fresh scent! Might be a bit too perfumey for those sensitive to heavy smells.	positif
1599	23456716	Great lotion scent for summer time very rich in fragrance smells like citrus. Keeps you smelling good and moisturized	positif
1600	10993895	This is my HG perfume. I love it so much but the price is outrageous. This is truly a splurge and my special occasion perfume. This scent reminds me of the natural scent of my mom, so for me it's an emotional familiar scent that I will always cherish. My daughter actually told me this smells like my natural scent which thrilled me.	positif
1601	18442358	At first I thought it was ok, but after only a few seconds it leaves this awful after smell. I just can't like it no matter how much I try. My partner can't stand the smell and my daughter told me a smell like a car freshener (I don't think that's a good compliment) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
1602	24299382	The smell!!!!!!!! So overpowering honestly love the color, love the feel and the pigmentation but can’t stand the smell! Really perfumy and pungent!	negatif
1603	16842571	Can't stand the smell.	negatif
1604	19542628	I think the shampoo is great and clearly works, unfortunately I can't stand the smell of the conditioner. I have been using it but in tiny amounts because the smell is synthetic and very strong. I would not purchase this out of choice literally because of the smell. Such a shame as the shampoo doesn't smell like this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
1605	16472844	It works amazing I just can't stand the smell. It smells amazing at first but once you have it I your hair it smells awful and the smell faids strange ave gets worse idk maybe it's my jell but it's the same brand but something happenes and I just can't take the scent	negatif
1606	4947769	This does nothing for me! The description says it's a dry shampoo however it doesn't absorb oil. It does makes your hair smell fresh but I can't stand the smell. The smell is way too overwhelming it gives me a headache! It smells like the Laura mercier pistachio body butter and personally I'm not too fond of that scent.	negatif
1607	11552063	I didn't care for this. It wasn't what I was expecting. It was patchy and I can't stand the smell. I gave this away... 	negatif
1608	19672629	WASTE OF MONEY Awful chemical smell	negatif
1609	10546056	My boyfriend wears it all the time but I don't really like the smell...maybe it doesn't smell good on him.	negatif
1610	16276284	I don't know what it is, but I just do not like this scent. I love vanilla but this doesn't smell like any vanilla I've ever smelled.	negatif
1611	4972297	gel consistency, bad smell, doesn't remove makeup well, doesn't clean (oily) skin. I have oily skin, and this soy face cleanser just does not work for me. It's a like gel consistency, and I thought that would be good, but it doesn't clean my skin..I still have oil in my pores after washing my face with this. It also claims to remove makeup, but it doesn't do that either. Maybe my standards are too high for skin care products? I don't know. But, I also can't stand the smell..it smells like cucumbers after they've gone bad. I wanted to like this product, the written details make it sound really good -- but it just isn't a good product for me or my oily skin. :(	negatif
1612	9223267	I can't stand the smell of this it reminds me of toilet cleaner for some reason all though I like the feel of it	negatif

1619	11015974	I don't like this product at all. It does some what help with dirty hair but not completely. It also smells terrible, like black licorice. I would not buy it again even if it worked because I can't stand the scent.	negatif
1620	4953655	This does not smell like black tea. I don't like the smell of it. Reminds me of smelly feet. I used it on my legs. Cannot bear to put it on my face.	negatif
1621	839599	Product doesn't smell like the perfume. Has a very bad smell. Will not recommend it to anyone.	negatif
1622	5445649	Didn't smell nice	negatif
1623	5027564	The smell is horrible. Strong distinct signature Lancôme smell. It gave me a headache and couldn't sleep because of the smell. Urghh..... Can't stand the smell to know if this product even works	negatif
1624	7785161	Loved this before they changed the package and the formula. Now I can't stand the smell. Good thing I stocked up before they made the switch to the new edition.	negatif
1625	24663868	Should’ve smelled it before buying it, my bad... Not moisturizing at all and I can’t stand the smell of it.	negatif
1626	7884773	I was so excited to try this and I honestly can't stand the smell of it. It's way to strong and smells like soap	negatif
1627	5067975	Was excited for this, it is exfoliating but, I can't stand the smell. It smells terrible and makes me not want to use it	negatif
1628	15910929	Nothing too special about this hairspray. The hold is quite decent but I can't stand the smell. I finished the bottle just because I paid so much for it. Will not purchase again.	negatif
1629	4690127	I wasn't impressed with this product. It left my skin with the greasy Feeland I can't stand the smell. I will not buy this particular product again.	negatif
1630	16888771	My skin felt really moisturized, but I can’t stand the smell. It smells like a rotten oranges . I can’t stand it.	negatif
1631	17114111	I love Carmex but absolutely hate the Cherry Carmex. I can't stand the smell or taste. I will never buy it again even though I still love the formula.	negatif
1632	17417237	Hate it. Can't stand the smell and the feeling on my lips. Given it multiple chances and I can't stand it.	negatif
1633	25778208	Smells Awful Smells awful. I love the package and the size but I can't stand the smell, is really strong and smells like old. Definitely I don't buy it again.	negatif
1634	1186128	Bad Smell,Sticky This made my skin feel sticky and not a fan of the scent either. I like a light rose smell but this doesn't smell like anything but a flower tea..	negatif
1635	5420553	I'm a big fan of BB creams and buildable coverage foundation. I thought that this product would be a harmonious marriage between the two.The first problem I have is that I can't stand the smell! It smells very strongly of a tropical/chemical scent. It fades pretty fast but when I first apply it, I feel sick to the stomach.Second, the color selection is off. I bought it in Medium and I'm an NC35. It was way too dark on me and the tone itself was on the orange side. Third, coverage was disappointing. Almost all of the other BB creams I've tried had much better coverage and with less product used.Fourth, consistency is watery. I typically prefer BB/CC creams that have a creamier texture.I bought this during the Sephora VIB sale as an impulse purchase. Will definitely be returning.Obviously not repurchasing.	negatif
1636	1267280	Absorbs Quickly,Goes On Smoothly Bad Smell Does not smell like pure grace at all will be returning	negatif

1639	1289242	Doesn't smell goid	negatif
1640	19904371	The rose tint lip treatment feels great on the lips but has a really bad taste. Not that I try to eat it but if it gets on the inner parts of my mouth you can taste it and it’s not good. It also doesn’t smell very nice 	negatif
1641	3058090	Don't like the smell	negatif
1642	10541885	Personally don't like the smell of this. I find it very overpowering. Some may like the potent smellOf perfume but unfortunately, I do not.	negatif
1643	1450525	I do not like this lipstick at all, there isn't any colour to it and I fell like I am ragging my lips back and forth with it to just see something, I will not be using this up as it does not meet my expectations, I can't stand the smell of this lipstick and I have noticed that all of this range smell the same, they are very perfumey. The range is huge and I did hope for better things from it.	negatif
1644	18606386	I had a MUA use this on me during a custom makeover at Sephora, and I did like the result, so I bought it. I tried it out a couple of times at home and then promptly returned it. It’s super sticky, like hair paste, and very shimmery. I didn’t find it to colour correct as well as my MUF concealer. I also can’t stand the smell.	negatif
1645	16159947	I absolutely can't stand the scent of this polish. It's chemically floral at best, but just gives me a headache. The color is pretty good, but overall this would not be something that I purchase again. The only upside is that eventually the scent does fade.	negatif
1646	3069250	I don't like smell, its looks very cheap.	negatif
1647	13763240	Didn't really like this product. Felt really think and greasy. Made me break out and didn't smell very pleasant.	negatif
1648	23864311	it didn’t really do anything for my lips also it was a little greasy and didn’t smell great .	negatif
1649	9041377	This scrub wasn't very abrasive, didn't smell great, and left my skin still feeling dirty. Gross.	negatif
1650	1310019	I use many Olay products and love them all. I purchased two large bottles of this lotion & I can’t stand the smell. I don’t know what to do with these. Ugh	negatif
1651	1280076	Feels tacky, smells like soap. I will probably just use it up as a foot cream. Bought it because it got so many good reviews, and much cheaper than other brands, but I just can't stand the smell, definitely won't buy it again.	negatif
1652	18515792	This stuff is terrible. I can't stand the smell of this stuff, or the taste (if God forbid any gets in your mouth) pass on this one for sure. There are so many better options out there. This is not a holy grail product, not even close.	negatif
1653	20285656	Bought this for a present for the mother in law who has always worn this and she can’t stand the smell and the fact that it don’t last for more than an hour so it’s a complete waste of money	negatif
1654	5259079	This has made me break out even more and on top of that I can't stand the smell. It smells so bad that I throw up! Definitely do not recommend for sensitive skin with acne prone. Lotus oil is so much better and well worth it than this one!	negatif
1655	7863906	This dry shampoo, in fact the whole Batiste range is awful. I really can't stand the smell and the stiffness of my hair after spraying it on my hair. I threw them in the bin.	negatif
1656	19044296	I was given about 10 stila lipsticks like this one and I can't stand the smell of them. I gave them to my daughter for play makeup and she doesn't even use them. She said they were too messy and stunk.	negatif
1657	16537614	With a name like Prada, I expect to be wowed, but this disappointed me. I can't stand the smell. When I think of candy, the word sweet comes to mind. This smells more like the plastic candy wrapper than the candy.	negatif
1658	25454532	I honestly can’t stand the smell of these lip products. They work a little bit but I can’t stand to have them on my lips because of the scent and consistency. I feel like it’s really sticky and gross. Wouldn’t recommend this.	negatif
1659	17315285	Works great for chapped lips just not my cup of tea. I can’t stand the smell of Carmax or the way it feels on my lips. I have tried the cherry kind as well still can’t bring myself to like it I will just keep to my chapstick!	negatif
1660	5472066	Don't like the scent.	negatif
1661	1295347	Doesn’t smell the same.	negatif

1669	3106381	Returned it as didn't smell genuine. Got refund.	negatif
1670	2489092	Not sure if this is a fake as didn't smell as usual	negatif
1671	4763458	Don't like the smell,and pratically had no effect on my skin,not hydrating or long lasting make up help...useless and really bad smell...don't like i'll return it!	negatif
1672	674961	don't like the smell at all	negatif
1673	1282447	Don't like the smell or consistency	negatif
1674	16492371	Personally I did not care for the scent. I found it to smell too minty/medicinal for me. It just comes down to preferences. My daughter was there when I spritzed it, and she loved the fragrance! She however can't stand the scent of Urban Decay's All Nighter Spray. And I think she is crazy for that!	negatif
1675	11012371	This just shows how much perfumes have come over the years... I never really cared for this scent when I was younger and I still don't like the scent it seems to overpowering .. There are too many wonderful smelling alternatives out there	negatif
1676	2490799	Box has awful chemical smell, may well be legitimate however past its best. Need significant application for what normally requires a couple of sprays.	negatif
1677	5844496	I really really loved this spray....and I still have a bottle of what I am assuming is this old formula. But I recently bought the travel size to keep at work, proving how much i love this stuff, well use to ....but I can't stand the smell!! Unless they revert back to the old formula I will not be repurchasing. So disappointing :(	negatif
1678	18516712	I feel this product is overrated. First of all, I believe it is too heavy, made my 54 year old skin breakout, did not make my skin smooth at all, really expensive, and most of all, I can't stand the smell. All of Hollywood may use it, but not for me. I really don't understand why everyone aspires to this line.	negatif
1679	5975071	I bought two of these while on special offer; used a third of one bottle and couldn't quite make out what the smell was that was lingering on my clothes then realized it was this oil. Am taking the other one back as can't stand the smell. Might make the skin nice and soft but can't put up with the smell on my clothes!	negatif
1680	15902831	I can't stand the smell. Unfortunately.It smells terrible to me, and I couldn't really get over that. The sunscreen did work fine, but the scent lingered for me. I'd say find it in store (they even sell it at Walgreens with testers), and try it in person. If the smell doesn't bother you, try it!	negatif
1681	19637599	Too sheer and smells awful I got this foundation because I wanted more of a sheer/medium coverage foundation. However, I found this to be way too sheer, thought it does give a natural glow. Also, I can't stand the smell. I've never had an issue with foundation scent but this is just awful. I will be returning it.	negatif
1682	15745609	I got this as part of a gift, and even though I can't stand the smell of artificial cherry, I still tried it because I've heard good things about the brand. Well, I couldn't give a full review because the second I put it on my lips, I wiped it off because it tasted like strong cherry cough syrup.	negatif
1683	5054695	I received a sample of this and I just can't stand the smell. God it's awful. So sweet and strong. I applied it all to my legs and ten minutes later my legs look dry again? I don't even have dry skin. I'd say this lotion is pretty useless.	negatif
1684	17397974	I love the formula of the body butter, but I can't stand the smell. It smells similar to cleaning supplies. The orange beads don't always sink into my skin which I end up flicking off my body. After 10 mins the smell calms down to a subtle fragrance. I wouldn't purchase this exact one again but I would go for the others in the line.	negatif
1685	17503396	I don’t like the scent at all it’s really an awful scent. Maybe if it wasn’t so pungent I wouldn’t mind as much. I’ve used it once because it’s all I had and haven’t bought it since. It was in the checkout lane as I was checking out so I grabbed it definitely won’t do that again.	negatif
1686	721359	I did not like this product at all. It didn't get sudsy and it didn't smell good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
1687	1147920	Don’t think the product I received is the correct formula. It didn’t smell good, and made me break out. Ended having to go to a target to rebuy	negatif
1688	14012201	I didn't like the strawberry scented body wash as it didn't smell very nice and I had to stop using it ,but it did do what it's supposed to do	negatif
1689	14874461	I was very disappointed with this project because I thought it would make me feel soft and smooth but it didn't. It also didn't smell as good as I hoped	negatif
1690	2496864	Sorry I didn't like this at all. It didn't smell as good as the promotion for it. Hardly anyone noticed I was wearing a new perfume.	negatif
1691	16196434	Didn't really like how my skin felt after and it also didn't smell the greatest. Wouldn't recommend to friends	negatif
1692	25445683	Didn’t like the scent of this at all it was way too strong even after a whole day. Gave me a headache and didn’t smell great on my skin either.	negatif
1693	14875915	I really didn't like this product. It didn't smell very good at all, and left a gross oily residue on my skin.	negatif
1694	1144299	It didn't smell like perfume or cologne, it smelt mostly like alcohol.	negatif
1695	1961542	my partner was not happy with this thought it didn't smell like the real perfume	negatif
1696	3112913	This looked like the real thing, but certainly didn't smell like the real thing.	negatif
1697	16011332	I don't like this product because it's very not pigmented and doesn't smell like chocolate like the others	negatif
1698	10407373	Ugh. The colors are way too dark and made me look orange. Doesn't apply well and doesn't smell good.	negatif
1699	5685551	Don't think it's real :( it doesn't smell like the proper one and seems to dry my hair out :(	negatif
1700	6204022	I don't get the hype. It doesn't smell beachy to me. It smells like Ivory soap.	negatif
1701	24667063	Orange scent nothing like full size bottle Unfortunately I WOULD NOT REPURCHASE. The Orange Sanguine cologne was extremely watered down. It did not smell anything like the full size bottle I have previously bought. It quite frankly didn't smell like anything but alcohol, and I can't detect any fragrance when holding it up directly to my nose. When applied it leaves the faintest *barely there* scent you have to press your nose against to detect. Very displeased and wish I could return.	negatif
1702	15225391	It smells like that vanilla flavored loose tobacco people buy from tobacco shops in order to roll their own cigarettes. I don't like the smell of tobacco and found it to be... overwhelming. I ended up showering to get it off after it didn't fade away. I can see how this one might be something that someone else appreciates, but it's *really* not my thing.	negatif
1703	5257661	Overall I am a big fan of Marc Jacobs products. I wanted to love this so bad! But it doesn't smell so great. It has a coconut scent to it but more like a sour after scent that does not smell good on your skin. Also, this was not a mist. Mainly large white droplets was on my skin when I sprayed it out. Very disappointed!!	negatif

1720	4758785	I agree with the previous review -- this smells terrible! I'm not generally picky either, but this has an overwhelming chemical smell.	negatif
1721	5596452	I don't always write reviews unless a product is really great or really awful. This one happened to be really awful. I got a sample with one of my Sephora orders and tried it today, unfortunately the scent was so strong it gave me a headache and a churning stomachache all day! The scent would not go away so one star for staying power but it honestly smells like a mix of flour tortillas and old lady floral perfume. This scent is too overpowering as I have found with many Tom Ford scents. However, if you like the scent of the neroli perfume, you will love this as it is similar and just as strong. Would not recommend if you prefer musky scents as it doesn't smell like most I have purchased.	negatif
1722	615964	Smells Bad Pureology stopped making my shampoo I used for years. I tried this, hoping it would good. I bought both the shampoo and conditioner. This is the worst smelling shampoo I have ever used. Today was the first (and only) day I have used it. The smell is not great in the shower, but tolerable. However, the smell gets worse as the day goes on. My hair has stunk all day. I can't stand the smell and my coworker said my hair smells like a gym bag. I am returning these products. Yuck!	negatif
1723	17611299	I know chanel no 5 is a classic but i just can't stand the smell. I had gotten it from sephora and returned it immediately. It is to expensive to give me such a big headache it smells really strong. It is more for older people in my opinion. I think its something you buy just to say you have it because ir smells really bad. I have other chanel perfumes that i love , i just hate this one	negatif
1724	24636171	OLD LADY MUSK I’m obviously in the minority here but I can’t stand the smell of this stuff! It’s so bad. At first it smells refreshing and minty but as it settles it smells like an old heavy musky perfume. Therefore it feels heavy on the skin and I can’t wait to wash it off. Makes my skin feel dirty. Can’t believe so many people love it.	negatif
1725	15699118	I hate the smell of this conditioner. It has great reviews on walmart which is why I tried it, but I literally can't stand the smell. Other l'oreal shampoos and conditioners smell amazing and this is the only one that is disappointing. I do not recommend this, but if you like the smell then I think the formula is better. I just can't recommend this to anyone because I am so turned off by the scent. 	negatif
1726	5020554	My face does well with many different oils. This one is just mediocre (got a few samples). On my skin I find it to be extremely greasy, taking at least a half hour to sink in. I also can't stand the smell. To me it just smells/feels like I'm smearing canola oil all over my face (which is also an ingredient in there anyway). The smell and feel of this oil sort of grosses me out.	negatif
1727	5191721	if i could i would give this no stars ! I got this as a spear point perk and I only used it once..and that one time it made my face feel so greasy and oily as soon as i put it on my face! and I can't stand the smell, it smells like tea tree oil but its so strong and i felt like it didn't mattify my skin and it didn't minimize the look of my pores like the description said. thank god i didn't buy the full size !!!!!!	negatif
1728	11328908	I received this as a birthday gift and I honestly can't stand the smell. I am thinking of re-gifting it. I have tried to get use out of it but the strong mix of floral and musky wood really throws me off. I believe many older people would be into this scent or people who prefer very specific or distinct scents. Personally I have a strong dislike towards it and it just lays around in the back of my perfume drawer.	negatif
1729	4707379	I have been looking for a product to brighten my skin and make it look more vibrant. I have fair skin and the oil is so heavily pigmented that I have to massage it in for a long period of time to get the orange tinge to fade away. I also can't stand the smell! I have another product by Philosophy that smells heavenly - a light, clean, orange scent. I swear when this, combined with the serum and cleanser, has the faint smell of something....herbal.	negatif
1730	11409390	So I received this Anti-aging Serum from Influenster, my first thoughts- not really a Serum. Serums to me are very thin liquid, this is more like a lotion (but not a cream) I'm not a fan of the smell either, kind of smells like old ladies. As far as helping with fine lines and wrinkles, it's definitely not an instant result but maybe it would help if I used it consistently. I can't stand the smell tho! #DiscoverOrigins #Contest #complimentary @Influenster @Origins	negatif
1731	5068441	I used a sample of this that lasted me about a week. I've been going through a lot of different serum samples I've had and this has been one of my least favorites. My skin has looked less even and no noticeable different in smoothness or texture. Plus I can't stand the smell of this either. It reminds me of hot dogs and the smell lingered for about an hour after I applied it each day.	negatif
1732	17589759	I have used it maybe 6 times. I can't stand the smell of it. It smells like silly puddy, you know the squishy kids toy from when we were younger. At first I couldn't place the smell. But I walked past a guy and he asked me where he could buy some silly puddy. And it hit me. That was it. That was the smell. LoL	negatif

1785	5135706	I personally couldn't handle the scent of it through the box. It was too strong and didn't smell good. I also was not impressed with the colors. I had to return this and do not think it was worth the money. I will stick with my chocolate bar palettes because they are amazing.	negatif
1786	15234751	I have to use a ton of product just to cover my face as it doesn't not glide on smoothly. It didn't smell like anything at all, especially not peachy, and my face was still oily at the end of the day. I will be returning and exchanging for something else!	negatif
1787	1912207	This is a fake product. Please don't buy if you want an authentic MAC lipstick. This didn't smell or look like Russian Red. Was brought as a gift from sister and it was obvious as soon as you opened the lipstick. Please purchase from MAC website for a cheaper and REAL product.	negatif

1812	662010	My husband uses this, and I hate the smell. After he uses this in the down stair's bathroom while I'm in upstair, I even smell it from upstair. The worst part is the smell lingers for a very long time even after my husband left for work. To get rid of the smell I need to open several windows of my house for a very long time. It's winter time, but I open windows because I can't stand the smell. (I bought no odor spray for him, but he somehow likes this, and continue use this. ) I'm afraid this spray may be toxic, the smell is that bad.	negatif
1813	6779496	I have pretty sensitive skin, but had heard great things about this product so I decided to buy it. But it was WAY too harsh on my skin to the point of hurting. Also, I can't stand the smell. It makes me feel like I'm putting alcohol on my face, and I'm someone who really really likes alcohol. I didn't give it enough of a chance to see if I'd love it, because I couldn't get past the pain. I did continue to use it on my underwear line for ingrown hairs. Now THAT was great. Just not on my face.	negatif
1814	16978205	I do not like this product at all! It came this month in my Ipsy glam bag, and when they gave the description they said that it smelled like heaven, and that they secretly used it as a perfume, so I was thinking I was going to get this great smelling, wonderful oil for my hair, but it stinks, I can't stand the smell of it, but decided to give it a try anyway to see if it helped tame my frizzy curly locks, and it did not, definitely not a fan of this product at all, and most certainly do not recommend it to others!	negatif

1844	23965617	It's eh. More like an expensive bar of soap that just cleans the skin. It left my skin dry. And itchy. It didn't smell the greatest either.	negatif

1848	4784560	I found this to have a really awful chemical smell, I tried to get past it, but I also found it drying, not particularly durable agaisnt eating or drinking as other reviews claimed, and somewhat glittery/sparkly. I returned it and will keep looking for a better pink lip stain.	negatif
1849	1311262	this can not be Amazing Grace! The smell could make you sick. Don't understand why this spray smells so bad. I have had samples of this. I loved it, couldn't wait to get it. What I got didn't smell anything like the samples. I will just go to a dept.store and buy it there, if it smells like my samples.	negatif
1850	5656098	Really disappointed, and embarrassed, as this had been bought as a gift. My wife has had this before and been really pleased with it. I purchased another in February as a present but now find the recipient didn't like to tell me that it didn't smell like Youth Dew at all, and was actually quite unpleasant. Of course it is now too late to return it.	negatif
1851	13773085	This wasn't my favorite toner. It didn't smell that great to start off. It claims to hydrate you face in the process and I didn't really see that when I used it. It didn't meet my expectations at all so I will not be repurchasing. I definitely regret buying this product	negatif
1852	6572900	I had high hopes for this product but I am allergic to it. Couldn't figure out why my eyes looked as if I had pink eye. Come to find out it was this make up. Tried a few didn't ones same out come. I don't recommend for sensitive skin also it didn't smell good at all.	negatif
1853	18309169	This product was very difficult to use and very messy. I feel like it needed to come with a brush to put it on. I tried it 3 times to see if I could get the hang of it, but the outcome wasn't worth the effort. It also didn't smell great and left my scalp super dry.	negatif

1855	9106156	Not a fan! I don't like the results, I find it didn't give me much color which doesn't make sense due to the fact that I have a very pale complexion. I find that drugstore self tanners work a whole lot better for a fraction of the price. Plus it didn't smell too good either..	negatif
1856	19626190	Doesn’t smell like the perfume at all :( Unfortunately to me, this doesn’t smell anything like the perfume :( I’m obsessed with Black Opium so I bought this immediately but will return.

1899	5261755	I was excited to try out the too faced liquid lipsticks! Unfortunately it had an extremely chemical scent which I find unusual as other liquid lipsticks from other brands that I own have pleasant vanilla scent or no scent at all. I tried it on once but couldn't get over that horrible chemical smell. Hopefully Too faced re-formulates their liquid lipsticks! But for now, I'm gonna stay away from their liquid lipstick and return Queen B.	negatif
1900	22437094	Already had bought this lipstick previously from a drug store but needed to replace so found what I thought was the exact number/name/make/colour. When the lipstick arrived it was in a different packaging to the one I have. When swatches it is two totally different colours as can be seen below, left swatch is the one I have and the right swatch is the one I received. As you can see the colour pigment is totally different as is the consistency/glossiness. Once on the lips it is a mucky sort of light brown colour compared to the one I have which goes on a nude-ish pink/brown. It also doesn't smell the same as mine it has a chemical smell. Not sure if this is a genuine product as I purchase another maybelline colour sensational one from a different seller and it smells just like my old one and is the same quality/packaging/glossy consistency.	negatif

1956	4879448	I don't like this moisturizer at all. It doesn't smell good and it barely makes my dry skin feel moisturized. I'm not sure why it has had such a following for so long. Would definitely not buy again.	negatif
1957	15124887	Didn't do much for my skin, might as well just wash your face with water. Plus it doesn't smell the greatest. It's extremely gentle on the skin, for me it was too gentle. I purchased it at Ulta. 	negatif
1958	15233068	I love trying new dry shampoos, but unfortunately this one did not work out for me. It leaves a super white cast, and even after rubbing it in, it does not help. It has a strange smell that doesn't go away. It doesn't smell clean or fresh at all.	negatif
1959	18373712	This stuff is not worth it at all. Doesn't work good, doesn't smell good and not worth the money. It looks nice but there's better products that do the same thing that are different prices. Ralph Lauren is always good but this is a no go.	negatif

1962	5227962	Very disappointed with this dry shampoo. I've used it 3 times so far, and each time it has done nothing to soak up the oil. Your hair doesn't feel clean after using it, and it doesn't smell great either.	negatif
1963	25769265	Terrible product Really wanted to love this product but it's just horrible, doesn't work, makes your hair feel sticky and semi wet and all sorts of weird. Hair becomes really flat after use. Only good thing about it is that it doesn't smell like chemicals because it's not aerosol	negatif
1964	1050983	Goes On Smoothly,Moisturizes Well,Not Greasy Bad Smell I used to use this scent and lotion many years ago and loved it. I know the company was sold and there have been many complaints that th scents are not the same but I missed using Amazing Grace so thought I would give it a chance. The scent is similar to what it used to be but now has a harsh chemical smell and just isn't the same soft, well-balanced, gentle and soothing fragrance it used to be. I found the scent in this formula also too strong and would never be able use it more than a tiny amount as the smell would be overwhelming. I also found the fumes stung my eyes. Will try to return. Very sad that I won't be able to enjoy Amazing Grace anymore. Such a shame they changed it and it's expensive. I did submit a comment to Coty, which now owns philosophy, but did not hear back.	negatif
1965	5416665	Can I just that by all means I do not have sensitive skin, but my face reacted horribly to this. First, it doesn't smell fresh, it smells like a bad perfume, i.e. alcohol, but I'm not one to complain about scent, so its not something that turned me off, but if you do have problems with scent, then this isn't the product for you.Second, its not a nice tingly sensation, it burns... like a lot for the first five minutes and then it calms down but its not a nice feeling.And lastly, the process of removing the product wasn't bad but once I took it off I saw that my face was red and my face rarely ever gets redness. I tried this product three times and I gave up on it. I didn't like it... Its not it didn't do anything, it did, it made my face a lot worse...	negatif

1970	15590110	I know the goal was to update this scent and make it younger, but I still feel like they missed the mark. The scent is overwhelming and does not smell like anything someone in their 20s or 30s would wear. I think the bottle is out of date still. Wouldn't suggest this to anyone.	negatif
1971	16762146	Literally one of the worst drug store products I’ve ever used. Very strong overwhelming chemical smell. Not good on my color treated bleached damaged hair. Even using a little leaves my hair tacky , sticky and damaged. This product actually made my hair worse .	negatif
1972	4753212	milky. Great at removing makeup, but leaves your skin with a lot of residue. Strongly fragranced as well. Not a bad product, just not worth $50.	negatif
1973	4831604	I got one sample to try it out. The sample is way darker than my skin tone so I used it as a contour. I only used it on my face and forehead contour area. It's good coverage, easy to blend. However, I don't know what do they put inside this one, my face was getting red and feel burned. After couple minutes, it calms down. My skin always get burned with alcohol product. I'm not sure if it has it. But I didn't smell any alcohol tho	negatif
1974	10665636	I really really wanted to love this shampoo but I didn't. It didn't smell the greatest which should have been a tip off to begin with. It doesn't suds up so you have to use a ton, or at least I did because I have super thick hair. After my hair dried it still looked oily and unwashed. I do not recommend this, at least not for thick haired girls.	negatif

1976	4707605	I bought this because it was cheaper than murad and had similar reviews. I normally use the Murad Acne spot treatment and I love that stuff! But I decided to give this a try and I hate it. It didn't do anything. I feel as though it almost made me break out more (?!) and it didn't smell good either. My boyfriend thought it smelt like taco seasoning, which we laughed about but now looking back I should've stopped using it sooner! I will be going back to the Acne spot treatment from Murad.	negatif
1977	19670571	Wanted to love it :( but no I wanted to love this SO badly I read all the reviews and couldn’t wait to try it but it did nothing to my lips!! I kept reading how it smells amazing and mine didn’t smell like anything ?! I’m not sure if I got a bad one but I’m very disappointed :( I feel like I wasted my money because my $2 chapstick did more than this, if I did get a bad one then I hope if you buy this that you get a good one!	negatif
1978	23329030	If you can, smell the palette before you purchase. This product absolutely reeks. I have never in my life had a palette that smelled rancid upon arrival (I ordered online). It’s unfortunate because the colors are really beautiful and blend really, really well, but I can’t stand the smell. Judging from a couple of the other reviews, this seems to be a problem with this palette in particular. The smell is so bad, and it transfers to wherever you put the product (which to me indicates that it’s the eyeshadows themselves, not the packaging). If you swatch them on your arm, your arm will smell. If you hold the palette up to use the mirror, you can smell it. You can even smell it on your brush if you dip one in there to apply it to your eyes. I hope the majority of this palette were produced without having this problem because it’s a real bummer. I don’t think I will try to exchange the one I have for one that smells better :(	negatif
1979	1254935	Bad Smell,Doesn't Absorb Well,Not Long-Lasting I had oringinally bought this product in hopes it would hydrate my skin and absorb nicely , unlike my previous one. It did neither. It was not hydrating what so ever and I still experienced the same dry and flaky spots on my face, and I don't even have dry skin! It also absorbs terribly! It feels like a thin sticky film on my skin after and it's not pleasant at all. To make matters worse, upon using the product it made my skin irritated, red, blotchy and plain embarrassing! It left my face burning and my eyes hurting. If you have sensitive skin, I would NOT use this. It left me with ugly red cheeks for days. Lastly, the smell doesn't smell natural or pleasant. It smells chemically enhanced.	negatif
1980	4889151	I received a free sample packet of this product from the Philosophy and noticed the ingredients are different on the product packet and the company website. Sephora peeps need to double check this. I think the ingredients info needs updating. So, I live in a hot weather area and the first thing I noticed when trying this product for the first time is that it smelled very yeasty. Yep. Yeast is an ingredient. In hot weather yeast doesn't smell so great and is not something I want on my face. I couldn't stand the bad smell and threw it away immediately. I rinsed my face off as well. So gross. Definitely something to keep in mind if you try this product. Especially if you are sensitive to yeast. Could cause a skin infection or really irritate sensitive skin. The new formulation of this product is a real disappointment. I would give this zero stars if I could. Not a winner.	negatif

2001	22441498	I have been using the Dove cucumber and green tea deodorant for years so thought this might also be a nice subtle scent. But it is a very overpowering chemical smell as a soap, definitely wouldn't recommend!	negatif
2002	25577163	I purchased this in the waterproof version = NOT waterproof! I had raccoon eyes w/in 60 minutes. Love the brush (reminds me a bit of L'Oreal Voluminous). The chemical smell is overpowering and I am not normally sensitive to smell = trash can!	negatif
2003	1311305	Do not buy from them. The scent goes after 30 seconds. It doesn't smell the same and doesn't last long. I think it's fake or is an old product.	negatif

2006	1002940	Pricey / Poor Value,Smells Bad I bought this shower gel based on the reviews. I don't find that it smells very nice. It doesn't smell like whipped cream at all. It needs something. . . .maybe more of an almond or vanilla note. It's bland and kind of gross smelling to be honest. The scent doesn't last past when you rinse it off either. This is fortunate because it doesn't smell good. I would describe the scent as slightly old vanilla milk that has been sitting out on the counter.	negatif

2053	22420628	Is this perfume genuine? It doesn't smell anything like the Blue Grass I remember, in fact it hardly smells of anything because it wears off very quickly.	negatif
2054	5807510	NOT a genuine Bourjois product. Smelled out of date and make my skin feel stiff and cakey. Doesn't smell fragrantly nice like my other Bourjois concealers have.	negatif

2061	20361758	Weird chemical smell. Awful. I had a pretty terrible, awful time with this. Crumbling. Bleeding. Feathering. Wearing off fast and lasting too long around outside my lip line. (Not intentional.) thankfully I had other stuff with me on my trip to use. This was not a good formula whatsoever. Forget it. Waste of time ?????&	negatif
2062	23322857	"I purchased this because of all the hype it was getting. I bought it online so I chose the color based on hudabeauty website recommendation. Turns out it was darker than I should have gotten, but that's on me because I should have gone to the store to try it first. I gave this foundation a low review because it was not easy to apply, it says ""a little goes a long way"" so I applied one pump, as specified, and blended with a beauty sponge. The problem is, it's not easy to blend in, once it was on my skin the thing stayed there, and I looked blotchy because of it. I tried to fix it because I was going to be at a convention and I was already running late, so I put on powder make up and went on. By the end of the day, I almost had no make up on and I looked like an umpa loompa lol. I read a lot about the scent of it and how it was overwhelming, I have no complaints about that, I actually liked that, and you really didn't smell it for the rest of the day. I returned this and I'm going to try Born this way by Too face, hopefully that would work better for me. I have sensitive skin and it's prone to redness in my cheeks and it is more on the normal side than oily, although it can be oily sometimes."	negatif
2063	1147969	I got a sample of this product, and it was disappointing. This oil does not remove any makeup from the face. I don''t wear waterproof anything, so the fact that it left all of the makeup still on my face after thoroughly washing in the shower, I give this product a thumbs down. Not only did it not cleanse my face, but it doesn''t smell great either.	negatif
2064	1283627	The bottle I received has a chemical fake-floral scent, almost like a men's deodorant. I really hate it. I am a rose gardener and know roses have a variety of fragrances- this doesn't small like any of mine. Not even remote hint of rose. Just a generic floral which doesn't smell natural. I am so disappointed. :(	negatif
2065	7201093	I feel like I'm the minority here but, I can't stand this. It doesn't do anything for my makeup. If anything, my makeup fades faster when I use this. The only thing I like about it is the spray bottle. It doesn't smell nice or really do anything, but man, that spray is nice. Definitely pass.	negatif
2066	14303922	Nope. Can't give this one a raving review. I am a repeat user of this product and after years of using it, I have come to the conclusion that it just doesn't smell good. It's pricey and stinky. I wouldn't buy it again and don't recommend it. There are other great smelling perfumes for the same price or even less expensive.	negatif
2067	23317570	Ick! I used some points to get a free little spray and I can't believe how lousy it stinks! Reminds me of soap and a campfire? I'm starting to think that freebies are completely different from the actual big bottle because nothing I ever get free smells good. This doesn't smell fresh or citrusy whatsoever.	negatif
2068	15638451	I didn't like the smel.. it doesn't smell like true rose, it smells fake powderly and scent doesn't last at all. Plus these are tiny samples, and it is advertised as much larger. Would have loved this if they were decent sized, I don't recommend it at all. I would recommend the wooden rose bag much better.	negatif
2069	10367129	Hated it didn't even cover anything what is the point of wearing it I'm an oily skin type and doesn't matter what skin u have it smells it burns a lil and no I would never use it i could stick to fit me smooth an dewy much better then this and doesn't smell gross and stuff all and all don't do it	negatif
2070	23233382	This isn’t a genuine product. Be very weary. It arrived without the Paul Smith dust bag, and smells of absolutely nothing. The actual perfume smells like a huge bouquet of roses, but this is slightly chemically water. I’ve bought this perfume for ten years, and I know the difference. Even my husband commented that it doesn’t smell anything like roses.	negatif
2071	8480986	I got this in a gift set from Sephora, and I have to say, I don't understand its purpose. I tried using it for a few weeks, and feel like it did nothing but make my skin feel super greasy. It also doesn't smell very good either. If you're looking for a good skin oil I would steer clear of this one.	negatif
2072	16978876	Honestly their products don’t work at all with my skin, they claim to be gentle but they’re so harsh they leave my skin itchy red and sore tbh. Doesn’t smell nice. I wouldn’t really recommend it as it did make me break out and my skin turned out worse than before I applied it honestly	negatif
2073	15890883	I bought this a while ago and I tried it but I didn't like it. Doesn't smell good and if your gonna have to put it on your face and leave it on your gonna want a pleasant smell. Also it burns/stings on the face and even leaves red spots. Definitely a no no.	negatif

2077	2008467	I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present. Sadly it did not live up to expectations as it had virtually no lasting scent. In fact it didn't smell anything like as good as the genuine item purchased at Debenhams.I returned the bottle and was given a refund.	negatif
2078	1929966	Unfortunately I had to return this item. The stopper inside was wobbly, the serum didn't smell quite right and because of the problems I wasn't sure whether it was genuine Estee Lauder. However, the seller was great and offered a replacement or refund immediately. I cannot fault them at all.	negatif
2079	25335547	Didn’t smell like the sample Got a sample of this and really wanted a large bottle, so I bought it. When I received it, I was really disappointed that it smelled nothing like the sample.. what happened? I had to return.	negatif
2080	2010656	I've used Eden for years and was surprised to find this didn't smell at all like Eden. The scent was very weak not like the 'full bodied' perfume I am used to. Tried it against the nearly empty spray I still have - no comparison. Have to return it.	negatif
2081	16755330	Didn't smell too great and it was much oiler than most serums I've used. It clogged my pores and made me breakout on my upper cheeks. It's a pricey product and it's too bad it didn't work for me :/ hopefully this gets fixed!	negatif
2082	6806845	This lotion was really watery and didn't smell nice. I did use it every day, once a day, after showering and I didn't think it showed any results. Wouldn't buy again or recommend to others.	negatif
2083	5887213	This hair dye did not take to my hair at all I had it on for the 30 minutes and nothing! It didn't smell like any hair dye I've used before. I have previously used this product and I feel like this particular packet may have not been what it seems!	negatif
2084	18173994	I have wavy to curly hair and I love to scrunch it to make my curls pop and this made my hair more flat. Watery consistency didn’t smell good. Gave me a lot of dandruff at the end of the day.	negatif
2085	16372879	I was not impressed with this product at all. It felt like Vaseline and had no pigment. It rubbed off almost immediately. I bought this from a local drug store. It didn't smell like anything. I will never buy this again	negatif
2086	7927180	I used the one made for blondes and it was absolutely terrible. At the time I had very blonde hair so when I put in the Batiste for blondes it left a brassy residue that didn't smell pleasant and I ended up returning it for the price- $9!!! Not going to ever buy that again	negatif
2087	22578865	I was not a fan of this mostly because the application was messy and it didn’t smell great. I also have an olive-tan skin tone and it washed me out. It did work well to minimize pores and left a matte finish, but it didn’t have enough color for me.	negatif
2088	5604175	This fragrance definitely got the salty beach sent down and not much of anything else... I didn't smell any of the other notes mentioned in this perfume. It didn't work for me, so I won't be repurchasing!!	negatif
2089	11967936	I tried this before I tried the coconut one, it was more expensive but figured since it said Brazilian like a Brazilian blowout that it might be better. I was disappointed it felt oily and didn't smell nice either.	negatif
2090	2490214	I had ordered this product before but in this instance it didn't smell quite the same and the fragrance dropped off rather quickly! May not have been genuine article or could maybe have been old stock. Decided to keep it anyway as it isn't unpleasant, just not quite how Adventure should be.	negatif
2091	18488483	I was really disappointed with this product. I just wanted a decent red lip stain that didn't smell like plastic or dry out my lips. Unfortunately, this did both. Maybe I'm overly sensitive to smells, but this reminded me of paint thinner. I returned it the following morning.	negatif
2092	17265678	I'm actually not a fan of masks like this. I feel like I'm being smothered. Not only did I dislike that but this one didn't smell great and left a film even after rubbing in and wiping off.	negatif
2093	4968263	This natural deodorant would be great, if it didn't smell like body odor after having it on for an hour or so. Ironic! A deodorant that smells like body odor! Wouldn't recommend.	negatif
2094	23036773	I was really excited to try this out but unfortunately didn’t work for me. The sent I bought was pure vanilla I wasn’t a fan of the smell it didn’t smell like vanilla it smelled musky	negatif
2095	22444305	Had to return the item as it didn't smell right. Have used this perfume regularly so know how it should smell (lovely!). When I checked the batch numbers online, found this one was from 4 years ago so maybe it had 'gone off'?	negatif
2096	3340627	Not genuine. Packed unsealed. Didn't smell right and fragrance disappeared after 20 minutes. Very very poor. But the real thing from a shop. Don't waste your money, worn this fragrance for years and this is not real.	negatif
2097	5058286	Did not care for it. Was blah and really didn't smell like much of anything after the dry-down. Kind of like a mixture of soap and something else kinda blah. Loved Midnight Oud and Gentlewoman from this line. (I have really bad allergies and can wear both without any trouble.)	negatif

2158	16342255	I don't really like the smell of this! It smells like medicine to me for some reasons!	negatif
2159	10539444	I personally did not like this scent. It was too overpowering and lasted too long. The bottle looks nice though.	negatif
2160	4864697	The first time I used this shampoo I didn't think it did anything special, but didn't think it was horrible. As my hair dried I noticed an extremely heavy, almost nauseating scent. I wasn't sure if it was this or a new styling product I used. The next 2 times I became much more aware of the scent and it was now confirmed that nauseating overpowering smell was from this shampoo. I also noticed by the third use my hair felt quite dried out after using it. I was also so turned off by the smell, I decided I can't use this stuff again. It lingered long after the shower. In fact, I thought the scent was more prominent when my hair was dry. It literally gave me a headache! If a product works wonders but doesn't smell great, I'll try and get past the smell and continue to use it, but this did nothing for my hair (except dry it out) so I won't be sacrificing scent induced headaches for the sake of a product that does nothing for me. I really wanted to love this stuff, but instead was extremely let down	negatif
2161	1011812	Didn''t find this product to be effective at all. My skin looks incredibly oily about two hours after I put it on, and there''s an awful chemical smell out of the tube. if you have any lines on your face it will find them. Coverage isn''t that great, but possibly that''s because it just melts off my face. (I also think I didn''t pick the right shade, but that one''s on me!)	negatif
2162	23693417	I wish I could leave a no star review. I’m so disappointed with this cleanser. It has an awful chemical smell to it that lingers long after I’ve cleaned my face. I understand this is mattifying but I hate how it makes my skin feel, like there’s a weird film over it. I have used the other micellar waters without issue but won’t be buying this one ever again.	negatif

2164	3145076	awful! bad smell! the worst perfume I have had. I already opened the bottle, could not return it. Will never waste money to buy perfume online... It is a fake perfume, nightmaremust buy ferfume at duty free where provides a real one.	negatif

2173	1274585	had a bad smell	negatif
2174	16812549	THE SMELL! The smell is so overwhelming! Im not usually one to care if a product has a strong scent, but this was way too much even for me. I could not stand to have it on my face for more than a couple of hours before I had to take it off because the smell was bothering me so much. It's not even that it is a bad scent, just that it is so overwhelming and overpowering and does not subside with time. For this reason alone, I absolutely do not like this cream and would never buy it (i will not even end up using the rest of the samples of this i got). Aside from the smell however, I don't think that this cream did much for me but I may not be its target audience, I think it might be for more mature skin.	negatif
2175	1263268	So first off I don't like the concept of the foam , you feel like you need a lot to get it all over your hair . I have extra long hair and then I can't tell if I got conditioner all over . Because it doesn't lather I can't feel if it went all over . I didn't smell anything from the conditioner. When I let my hair air dry a little then comb it with a wide tooth comb my hair was very sticky , is the best way to describe it . It wouldn't detangle or come out smooth . So overall I didn't have a good experience with the product . I need a product that doesn't leave my hair like that . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2176	23319784	no I don't usually write reviews but this lip gloss was horrible, it smelled weird, tasted AWFUL when I got some in my mouth rubbing my lips together - it sort of tasted chemical-ish or medicinal or something gross that I can't describe. Not to mention it is not moisturizing at all, and sometimes BURNS. When my lips were really chapped, I would put some on and the burning would be unbearable. As for the shine and what not, it wasn't that shiny and it is a kind of thin slippery formula, which could have been enjoyable if it didn't smell disgusting, taste disgusting, and burn my lips.	negatif
2177	3106505	I didn't like this product because:* It didn't smell like Thierry Mugler's Alien (TMA). Fragrance was different, and not as nice, but similar.* It wasn't as strong as a TMA eau de parfum normally is.* Each TMA comes with a unique code you can register. It had been removed (see pic).* A normal TMA eau de parfum 90ml comes with an embossed lid on the packaging. This came with lid that had an easily-removable shiny bit of paper in its lid. (See pic for comparison.)* Pic shows handy pouch. Did not come with pouch.	negatif
2178	4778319	hard to use. The steamer is poorly made of cheap plastic, it's small and not convenient to use at all. When you try to fill it with water , it spills all over the place and when you need to empty the cup after you're done steaming it's really hard to get the cup out and you splash water again all over. By the way, use tap water like the instructions says cause, otherwise , it might break . and don't try to add any oils like I did ( i added some eucalyptus oil , well , because without it the steam didn't smell good, so the whole plastic top just cracked ) . So I basically just wasted my money on it after trying it one time. wasn't worth it at all.	negatif
2179	19515863	Used the shampoo could have don't with some fragrance in it. Didn't smell of anything. The conditioner had a weird smell to it n was really thick like glue.really thought I was gonna have problems getting it out my hair but to my surprise it washed out easily n made my hair feel so soft. Next was to put the heat volumiser to its test. Put 3 pumps in my hair as I have long hair. N started blow drying . The product made my hair stiff n feeling rough like straw couldn't even get brush through hair to detangle after 30mins of struggling to style I ended up having to wash hair again... do not recommend product.

2180	24210370	Originally loved this perfume but after awhile got tired of the smell.  It started to give me headaches.  My brother even commented that it didn't smell great on me.  I understand that perfumes are a personal choice...so it must not work with my chemistry.  i thought is smelled great on the paper at first.  Too bad it didn't work for me.  	negatif
2181	14891052	I pick this kind up a couple of months ago and used it two time and didn't like it at all. The after smell was harsh. It didn't smell good at all. I will not be buying this one again. I did tell my family about this one and how it smelled after the shower.	negatif
2182	23843363	This product is a NO. When I opened the jar I hated the smell it gave me. It didn’t smell like a mask at all, smelt like wet dog. It took forever to dry down and didn’t even do anything but break me out. I was so mad the next day that I just threw it in the garbage.	negatif
2183	1958657	I am inclined to believe that the Olaplex I received was a fake, it smelt similar to the real thing but was an slightly off colour and didn't smell exactly like the actual Olaplex (which I obtained from a local salon). It did very little for my hair. I shall not be repurchasing from dubious sources again.	negatif
2184	4990500	If you want to smell like the coppertone baby then this is for you. I was so excited to receive this package from Sephora that I tried convincing myself that I didn't smell like sunscreen. My fiancé turned to me and said why do you still smell like sunscreen at 9pm? That's when I was committed to returning it. Bummer!	negatif
2185	3111719	I normally buy this brand perfume from high street and abdolutely love it. Due to the price , I decided to buy from Amazon. However it is a big dissapoinment . It didn't smell authentic and the perfume doesn't last long once applied compared to hight street which could last more than 8 hours. I am so dissapointed and will not risk buying any perfume from Amazon again	negatif
2186	17557148	This burned by skin. It also didn't smell good. Maybe I got a bad batch? It was pretty pricey for it to burn my skin to the point I couldn't use it. I don't usually have sensitive skin either. Maybe I would try it again if it's on sale.	negatif
2187	16979327	Yuck. Made me break out and didn’t smell too good either.. The product seems really harsh on sensitive skin so I now stick to more natural scrubs that aren’t too gritty. Wouldn’t recommend really, there’s better scrubs with natural ingredients that aren’t going to damage my skin	negatif
2188	19094143	I generally love citrus scents, but for some reason, I really didn’t care for this smell. It didn’t smell too citrus to me and more like kind of how a key lime pie would smell. I was disappointed, but I wore it for a bit to see if I grew to like the scent and unfortunately, I did not. The scent just wasn’t for me.	negatif
2189	5440114	Extremely disappointed with this product. The bottle leaked and the silver coating peeled off. Didn't smell like the real perfume. Once on the scent did not last like usual and you would have to wear a lot in order to smell remotely like the fragrance and you would have to top up. I won't be buying this product again.	negatif
2190	1058183	Not sure why I got this product as Volumizing is the exact opposite of what I need, plus I don''t use hair spray. I have a TON of long, super thick, coarse wavy hair which I flatten to within an inch of its life to try and contain & control it. I prefer a sleek look vs volume. I gave this product a go anyway. No bueno for me. It''s only redeeming factor for me is it doesn''t smell horrible.	negatif
2191	995765	I''ve been a Philosophy shower gel and bubble bath fan for years, and would give five stars to most of them, but I''m sure this is the worst smelling product they make. I can''t describe it in any other terms than awful. It doesn''t smell like a margarita. It''s almost toxic to one''s senses. It makes me sad to say that because my daughter got it for me and I used it all, but didn''t like it one bit.	negatif
2192	18148511	I really don't understand why Chanel Coco Mademoiselle has lots of good reviews when it honestly sucks. I have never gotten a compliment while wearing it. I just wear it so I can finally finish the product and because I had heard about someone that liked it. Initially at the store I thought it smelled okay but now the scent doesn't last and it doesn't smell sexy or womanly. Mostly smells like a grandmas perfume. I had better compliments with victoria secret scents and my versace fragrance.&nbsp;	negatif
2193	1390736	I didn't like this face cream at all. It doesn't smell very nice and has a heavy greasy fell on the skin. I have dry skin but the cream seemed to stay on the top difficult to rub in and didn't hydrate the skin at all. However I found the night cream very hydrating, its more like a gel and glides onto the skin leaving a cool fresh feeling of moisturised skin. My product recommendations	negatif
2194	5089626	I got the sample with one of my Sephora orders. Thought I would try it tonight for a No makeup makeup look. It smells bad. Like someone said musty old towels. I came online to see if it was me or the product. I can't wait to get home to wash it off! Really wanted to like it. I love love my Double wear, thank god it doesn't smell like this. Sorry.	negatif
2195	15673507	Recently tried this and I don’t like it at all. The packaging is obviously stunning so I had to see what it was about. It doesn’t smell very floral to me. It kind of comes off as a kid spray really. Or maybe a candle at Bath and Body Works. Doesn’t really have a scent that I would think compliment a person. I wouldn’t purchase a full size for myself.	negatif
2196	5939086	This product dries way out way too much. Not only does it flake off and get in my eyes, but it doesn't do any good for my skin. I will have pimples the next morning from this mask. Tried as a sample I received in the mail. Doesn't smell good AT ALL, other clay masks do a much better job that this very poor and cheap quality product. DO NOT BUY	negatif

2199	4718591	Ugh, I really don't like this stuff. It's easy to put too much on, I have dry skin so it looks really bad on the flaky parts. It smells awful when you are applying it, but when it dries it doesn't smell. It doesn't stay on at all, even with primer, but with the urban decay set and spray it does... So I had to buy an extra product for this to work. I wish I could return it or exchange it or that the bottle would just be empty already.	negatif
2200	4799807	I love St Tropez tanning products. However, this didn't (or hardly) worked for me. I used it at least 4 times a week for about 7 weeks (when I ran out of the bottle) and it made me maybe a shade darker. I have very fair skin and used it from January-March. I wanted to love it because it doesn't smell/get on your clothes but I will not be repurchasing.	negatif
2201	19515903	I truly didn't like this product - it has nothing to it in my opinion, doesn't look great, doesn't smell nice, doesn't do anything at all for my hair! Such a shame as I had very high expectations for the brand and the product. Very disappointed and won't be buying so cannot recommend it sorry!!

2203	24660307	Fragrance Overload I received this in my Play! box, and though I like the texture and felt it was effective and gentle, it is extremely strongly fragranced.

2207	19935078	Not a huge fan at all. Over the years, I have known so many people that used to wear this exact same fragrance to the point if i smell it now, it makes me sick. Has a very weird smell to it. I don't like this scent at all.	negatif
2208	7818617	I don't like this scent at all. I feel as though it is to strong and is totally overrated. I bought it at Belk and it was in a nice bottle but just smelled bad. It didn't last as long as my other perfumes. I would not recommend this perfume for anyone.,	negatif
2209	23506496	I’m not a fan of this, it was very powdery and I felt like it just sat on my skin. It seemed very orange for my fair cool toned skin. I also don’t like a scent so that was a negative.	negatif
2210	5123626	I really don't like this scent. It smells like cologne. I received his with the Sephora Play Box. I read on the packaging that is can be for a man or woman. I gave it to my husband and he likes it.	negatif
2211	7841450	I don't know why I don't like this scent. It is so expensive yet smells like a grandma. The packaging is absolutely beautiful and so girly but I just can't get over the old lady smell. I got a sample and would definitely not purchase this.	negatif
2212	18773790	I am not a fan of the Fresh lip treatments. I really don't like the scent and taste of any I've tried (and I've tried several). For the original version, the scent is particularly strong and unpleasant to me.	negatif
2213	14847655	Thank the stars above I got this as a sample and didn't spend a penny on it.I don't like the scent at all. I think it smells like cheap discount soap that looks pretty but you're never supposed to use. YUCK!	negatif
2214	14813431	I don't like this scent personally because it is very strong and masculine to me it is also a heavy scent when u spray it on so it lasts but is very strong, i like a more toned down masculine scent for women and would not buy it i only had a sample from sephora	negatif
2215	10540918	I received Vera Wang Embrace Periwinkle and Iris from Influenster for free. I have to say I don't like this scent. I prefer a flowery scent but this smells more powdery than anything. I would not buy this.	negatif
2216	11669904	Definitely better than the original Carmax. Although I still don't like the scent or texture of the product, it didn't make a big enough difference for me to ignore the assault on my nose	negatif
2217	10837531	I don't like this scent at all. It just isn't for me. It's too strong when you first put it on but the scent doesn't last very long after that. I just don't like it. I wouldn't recommend it. 	negatif

2220	1481185	I’m done! Not the same as the old product at all. Doesn’t smell or feel the same. And why would you get rid of the beads? That’s what I liked best about the old formula.	negatif
2221	1126926	"Sprayer came broken, amazon say's ""not eligible for return"" Seriously, what I am supposed to do with a broken 50 dollars bottle of perfume? Also, doesn’t smell like the original scent. But can’t tell for sure, because it’s broken! Very disappointed."	negatif
2222	1255485	Sprayer came broken, amazon say's not eligible for return Seriously, what I am supposed to do with a broken 50 dollars bottle of perfume? Also, doesn’t smell like the original scent. But can’t tell for sure, because it’s broken! Very disappointed.	negatif
2223	1311290	Did not realize was not 100% oil until I noticed my skin did not feel moisturized. Read ingredients. Oil is not even the first ingredient! Grrr. Makes sense now. I like it doesn’t smell but it is not oil!	negatif
2224	707527	I LOVE the Amazing Grace scent and have bought pretty much everything in the line to rest out. This doesn''t smell like it at all... it''s a completely different scent and no where near as pleasant as Amazing Grace. Definitely returning.	negatif
2225	5259708	This IMO doesn't smell much like it's sister flowerbomb!It has a manly musky undertone no fruitiness at all.I had high hopes for this one.. stick with Flowerbomb if that's your go to fragrance or try Bon Bon also from Viktor and Rolf.	negatif
2226	19619883	It doesn’t smell the best Not sure if this product actually works the way it’s supposed to and I probably won’t find out either because this setting spray smells to bad to put all over my face. Will be returning it.	negatif
2227	15247142	This product was suggested to me because of my oily skin. It did not help, and actually made my skin feel even more oily. It gave my skin a tacky and sticky feeling as well. It doesn't smell like peaches and cream to me at all.	negatif
2228	14902052	It doesn't smell like anything and that annoys me. Plus I don't think it gets my skin super soft and smooth feeling for a very long time at all. Not a fan.	negatif
2229	5894911	This doesn't smell quite right for Youth Dew and the smell doesn't last long - after a few minutes it has faded. If I had not started to use it and had not thrown the box away I would have returned it. I'm not sure it truly is Estee Lauder Youth Dew.	negatif
2230	25848033	To start off this mascara smells like pure chemicals. Most that i have doesn’t smell like that. Its just gross. And then when i applied it all it did was gunk. And the brush was not even applying it well.	negatif
2231	1909387	I've used Decleor products for years and I think this product is a fake! It doesn't smell or look the same as it usually does. The colour is very pale. I won't be ordering Decleor through Amazon again.	negatif
2232	25678134	Doesn't smell like Aromatics & doesn't last. It's either very old stock & gone off or possibly a copy. Certainly won't by again. Nasty & waste of money.	negatif

2234	1909233	I received a USED product. The eye cream was already in the tube and there were smears on the side where it had obviously been used. It doesn't smell like usual either and am very concerned it's not even the right product. Not acceptable at all	negatif
2235	1963950	Mine was dispatched by Joli Beauty. Doesn't smell anywhere near the one I bought from Oxford st ( You know where) Goes completely odourless in 20-30 minutes unless you can afford to apply it every 5 minutes or so :):)	negatif
2236	22421114	Not real, Amazon shouldn't be allowing these to be sold what a waste of money. The smell is literally gone as soon as you put it on and it doesn't smell like the real thing.	negatif

2238	14012109	I had high hopes for this shower gel, but after using it the first time, it felt like cheap soap. It doesn't smell good at all, and it does nothing to help with my skin. I will not buy this again.	negatif
2239	14866368	Not a good use for fragile skin, plus it has a perfumey smell and honestly doesn't smell very good. it doesn't feel like its cleaning my face. i regret buying it honestly.	negatif

2241	10720079	I got lace detail and it is horrible. It doesn't smell that good and it goes one clumpy (if that makes sense) it's sheer and to me it just seems like a lip topper rather then a liquid lipstick. It feels like what Cakey foundation would feel like on your lips	negatif
2242	15177082	This is the worse conditioner that I ever used from KÃ©rastase. It Left my hair very dry and dull. It is very strange but doesn't smell like a KÃ©rastase product. I will never buy it again.	negatif
2243	1378126	Smells awful (like off wine) doesn't smell fruity or nice at all. It's also very greasy so it doesn't sink into the cuticles. Would not recommend. My product recommendations	negatif
2244	15607294	To heavy for fine hair. Doesn't smell very good and is very runny for a conditioner. I like my conditioner to be more creamy. When I use this shampoo I feel like I have to wash my hair more frequently.	negatif
2245	19166922	I wish I had never bought this shampoo! It doesn't smell nice, it doesn't lather at all in my hair and it makes my hair greasy the next day. It does absolutely nothing to my hair and I will not be buying this again	negatif
2246	23789946	Hard to get out and doesn’t smell that nice, the colour looks dirty and doesn’t look like a clean brunette and you can tell it’s a spray in hair dye, It also stains your clothes I wouldn’t recommend this	negatif
2247	1959059	This is a fake. It doesn't smell anything like the real thing. I thought at this price it was too go to be true, and I was right. Will be returning it for a refund.	negatif
2248	17415167	The formula is not great, it creases A LOT, and doesn't smell very good. I had such faith in this concealer and it failed me. The coverage was not great and just dried out my undereye area. I wouldn't recommend it.	negatif
2249	3063832	Not happy with this product. The only reason I havnt returned is that I purchased it far in advance of the birthday I wanted it for. It doesn't smell like the original one I sampled in a repituble perfume shop and it last about an hour. Would not recommend.	negatif
2250	3110848	I received this for Xmas and really disappointed it certainly doesn't smell like the real thing. I didn't think to return it after I had opened it and tried it and am now with a perfume that isn't very nice	negatif
2251	5202413	I have been using Sugar for over 11 years. They changed the formula so much that it doesn't smell anything like the original. Smells like Fresh Life with lemon. Gives me a migraine now. So disappointed.	negatif
2252	5845474	not good. So this product doesn't smell very good and doesn't do much. Okay, it actually does nothing. Tried it for a week and my skin kinda looks worst than it did before, it definitely did not make it look better.	negatif
2253	6214183	For the price I guess this product is okay but it doesn't smell good nor does it make you face feel clean. I don't think I'd ever buy this again.	negatif
2254	5266021	I LOVE the Amazing Grace scent and have bought pretty much everything in the line to rest out. This doesn't smell like it at all... it's a completely different scent and no where near as pleasant as Amazing Grace. Definitely returning.	negatif
2255	8707451	Eh it's not the best facial mist. I was very attracted to it because of the packaging which is totally adorns, mermaid vibes and girly. But the product it self doesn't smell to good. Eh not sure if it's effective. Wouldn't rememond it for he price. 	negatif
2256	24143455	This is ok. It doesn’t smell the greatest and I didn’t really notice it help make my makeup last long. I got it as a little sample from Sephora but definitely test it first before you buy it and waste your money.	negatif
2257	10550781	It really doesn't smell good. I got it to test out free from here and I'm glad because I would never buy this. It's to many scents that don't compliment each other at all. Not sure how it has such good reviews. My opinion is honest	negatif
2258	22586243	This perfume doesn't smell like vanilla at all: it smells like an artificial, super chemically-altered version of vanilla that is rather unpleasant in my opinion. The scent also doesn't last long once applied. Don't waste your money on this.	negatif
2259	3193882	AVOID AT ALL COSTS! When it arrived I thought the box smelt funny, then i realised the box was damp, after giving it as a gift when opened up and tried it doesn't smell how it should. Not impressed.	negatif
2260	25763429	Nothing sugary at all Very disappointed. This perfume doesn’t smell any sweet to me. It’s citrusy which I hate. They still didn’t come up with anything better than original Prada Candy. All other versions just worse and worse. Except gloss probably. Has to be returned.	negatif
2261	22420927	Very strong and doesn't smell good on me at all. I can imagine it on a 50+ year old woman but I'm only 33. This is just not my cup of tea. I got headache from it and felt sick.	negatif
2262	5257664	I really wanted to love this product. I love everything coconut. But the design is horrible. It does not spray as a fine mist and instead looks like I threw water on after applying my makeup. It doesn't smell very much like coconut either. Super disappointed.	negatif
2263	10537603	This smelled like bathroom spray. I've never been a large fan of Marc jacobs perfumes on me. I've true daisy -hated it! And honey is even worse, I tried it a few times and it never mixed with my chemistry. It just doesn't smell good.	negatif
2264	5048646	Received this as a sample, and I was originally excited until I squeezed it out. It smellls DISGUSTING. Doesn't smell like mangosteen at all, it smells industrial, like glue or paint. The tint is also REALLY orange. King of like a bad spray tan.	negatif
2265	3060336	I have used Angel perfume for many years. However this one doesn't smell the same,the scent doesn't linger on my clothes as Angel perfume always does. Within minutes of application, the scent fades to something that does not resemble Angel perfume. Very disappointed with this.	negatif
2266	10772883	I did not like this dry shampoo at all it really felt like a buildup in my hair and made it feel nastier than it did before also doesn't smell too great and is not very easy to blend in with dark hair	negatif
2267	4868494	I need to return this. The oil and body wash is so much better ... The lotion doesn't smell great at all. It's awful. Save your money, or better yet spend it on their new Moroccan rose gold perfect dry oil, that is amazing.	negatif
2268	5655994	Not Obession. Must be cheap imitation or off. There is faint smell of Obsession, but when it's sprayed onto the skin it doesn't smell right. Also stains your clothes. Will not be buying from this seller again.	negatif
2269	2381886	Should've realised it was too good to be true. Sadly it does appear to be fake. Too yellow in colour, doesn't smell quite right and doesn't last very long.	negatif
2270	2393853	The perfume doesn't smell of anything nice in particular. They prob discontinued it because it wasn't selling well... the fragrance is rubbish and doesn't really smell of anything nice in particular... I am considering returning it	negatif
2271	3057788	So disappointed. Supposedly my usual perfume but it's not. It doesn't smell the same, the fragrance doesn't last and the actually perfume colour in the bottle is much paler. Obviously as fake, very disappointed ...I can only recommend DON'T PURCHASE & WASTE YOUR MONEY.	negatif
2272	2483564	This is a fake perfume. It doesn't smell anything like the eau de toilette. I have used this perfume for years and this is not the real thing. I would rate Zero if I could	negatif
2273	6125773	Not impressed, doesn't smell right, I spray it on the smell is gone before I leave the house,I have used this for years, bought elsewhere usually but took a chance with this and regret doing so, I know Le Male when I smell it and this is just wrong.	negatif
2274	22453609	So disappointed with this! Doesn't smell at all like product or so old it's off! To add insult to injury when I contacted to say how disappointed I was (and had to damage box to open so could not return) customer service reply was awful! Not even an apology offered.	negatif
2275	2383019	I have been using this perfume for years and from reading the positive reviews, I bought the perfume on Amazon. I can say that this is not an original, doesn't smell of anything. Complete waste of money. Do not buy!	negatif
2276	8617779	This is literally the only Lush product I absolutely hate. It doesn't smell like coffee at all. It smells like chemicals or something. It stinks so bad I can't leave it on my face.	negatif
2277	5665241	ZERO stars. I think this must be a fake! It doesn't smell at all like lavender and is akin to just dampening your pillow with febreeze. The scent (which is a bit clynical and soapy) disappears within minutes anyway. What a waste of money!	negatif
2278	17228754	It's expensive and it doesn't smell good. Also it leaves a whitish residue that I don't like since I'm a brunette. I won't purchase this again but it's found at Ulta. I don't recommend this product at all.	negatif
2279	14400325	This product disappointed me. It doesn't smell good at all and the conditioner didn't work what so ever. I haven't even finished either one of the bottles which is saying something because I go through shampoo and conditioners like candy.	negatif
2280	5670999	I have used the Gatineau floracil eye make up remover for some years and have loved it. This replacement doesn't smell as nice, slight nail polish remover smell and a little stingy on my eyes and I don't have sensitive eyes. Disappointed and won't be buying again. Bring back Floracil.	negatif
2281	2450897	If you have a real scalp condition ( I have seborrhoeic dermatitis) this is pretty much useless!No contest against Nizoral, even Capasal Therapeutic shampoo will give better results I guess the only positive is it doesn't smell!	negatif
2282	5990035	My wife used this now our house stinks of it. I had to laugh at 'light fragrance'. Doesn't smell like something you should be using to wash your hair with. It might cure itchy scalps but you will smell like a walking chemistry set.	negatif
2283	8838962	This toner did not do anything for my skin. It doesn't smell good, it doesn't tone or form my skin, it does not do anything! It's a waist of money, you are better off looking at TJMaxx. The packaging is nice but I don't recommend.	negatif
2284	12740938	There was such a big hype about this product, and I would love to know why! Literally no difference or whatsoever even though I used all of it. It doesn't smell good at all either. Very disappointed with thus product and I wouldn't buy it again.  	negatif

2287	13410915	This product is ok. I prefer other products that are similar. I think this product weighs down hair and doesn't smell as good as other comparable products. I have dark brown hair with some grey. My hair is also very frizzy. I wouldn't buy this again.	negatif
2288	18864271	the packaging to the perfume is really pretty and while I love the scent on others when they wear it it just doesn't smell good on me I feel like I'm wearing an elderly womans fragrance	negatif
2289	18513435	Not for fine straight hair, unfortunately, I'll have to keep searching. Doesn't smell pretty, and it gets quite sticky, not to mention, no waves. I'm sure it would help people with wavy hair, but the product isn't for me.	negatif

2291	14835721	I do not like this at all. I have found that when pomegranate is used in any body spray/lotion it doesn't smell the way I guess it would taste. Sweet or a little tangy. Nile they should just leave the fruit alone and just keep as juice or a nice snack!	negatif
2292	18817579	Yes it stays all day but makes your face smells so gross. It’s difficult spraying it on your face when you don’t even like the smell	negatif

2303	11749285	Great applicator, however rest is rubbish - colours are pretty but not very pigmented , does not last, and very very drying on the lips. The packaging I like, but the taste is uninviting. I really don't like the smell or the taste.I will not repurchase.	negatif
2304	23094428	This setting spray didn’t work for me. I followed the directions but I could still notice oils coming through. I don’t like the smell of the spray. This setting spray is overpriced. The pros are the packaging is nice and it is refreshing on the face.	negatif

2306	15466001	I don't like this smell at all. It is so very strong and musky. It smells like a really old person should be wearing it. It's not flowery, it's not fresh. It's just a very strong, harsh musky scent. I would not recommend it at all.	negatif
2307	5619253	At first I thought this product was alright, but after a wee or two of using it it caused a full on break out on my cheeks and forehead. It still hasn't gone away after using it. I also don't like the smell, it's smell quite natural and a bit mature.	negatif

2311	13076612	This product does not work for me at all. I do not like the Roller it applies with. I feel like I cannot get it directly on the spot of the breakout. I don't like the smell and it just doesn't work. I do not recommend this.	negatif
2312	12875123	I'm not a fan of this product. I don't like the smell and I think the packaging is very boring and cheap. I also don't like the way it makes my skin feel. However saying that it does the job is removing makeup well.	negatif

2328	8484603	It feels good on the skin but I don't like the smell. I wish it didn't have a smell. I received a sample and I haven't used all of it and I don't think I would buy it especially because it's not cheap	negatif
2329	19972186	I don't have this product, I got it as a gift, but I really don't like the smell it has and where I do use it i have gotten little break outs, I wanna use it but it's frustrating.	negatif
2330	13675809	I don't like the smell or texture of this which is unfortunate as I really like origins products,so I was dissatisfied and I thought it was very prucy was not worth the money!! It was gentle but could if been better... I wouldn't reckoned to others 	negatif
2331	8616050	I really liked this mask. A lot of people don't like the smell but I love it actually. Lush has good skin care products but they could help a little better thy aren't the worst but they aren't the best.	negatif
2332	14335639	I don't recommend Lush products because firstly, I don't like the smell of the products. secondly I feel like they are a reason for me breaking out as well as many of my friends. their products are quite expensive too so I don't think it is worth buying.	negatif
2333	22648920	Too harsh on my skin. I don’t like the smell. It did not meet my expectations but might for others due to skin type. I tried it multiple times and it was just too harsh. I wouldn’t recommend.	negatif
2334	16121284	I've tried this product in the past and will not buy it again. I don't like the smell and it leave my lips sticky. I like smooth lips. It also wouldn't last that long. I always ended up taking it off.	negatif
2335	11285424	The colour is ok, however the consistency of the product is a little offputting. It is very sticky, and my hair gets stuck on to it. I also don't like the smell of the product, I feel like these go bad much faster than others.	negatif
2336	8803658	Smell is very very harsh and I don't like that smell it's a decent price though!! Packaging could use a little work as well it's something I only use when I don't have other sunscreen it's effective but I wouldn't recommend it	negatif
2337	8840362	Don't like the smell of this toner. Too much. I also don't feel like it's actually toning my skin. It almost leaves a weird film behind. I wish it was just a bit stronger. I will not buy this product again.	negatif
2338	23909853	For me personally I don’t like the smell and I don’t like the way it feels on my skin after I wash it off. It doesn’t feel moisturized at all. I can’t find lotion fast enough to get that feeling it gives me gone!	negatif
2339	8809666	I Don't not like this sunscreen for a couple reasons I Don't like the smell and how sticky it leaves your skin and it does not go in smooth and for the price you might. As well go with another brand cuz this is not a good brand	negatif
2340	24324967	I don't like the smell or the dryness it leaves. Lotion should moisturizer not dry out your skin. Haven't used it much since it is a travel size so my recommendation may not be the best to go by. I usually buy travel sized to test things since they are cheap	negatif
2341	18666152	I am so disappointed in this product. I don’t like the smell. It doesn’t work. I’ve been using it every second day for two weeks on only certain areas so i can gauge color and nothing! A total waste of money and it’s not cheap!	negatif
2342	12050100	Don't like this product at all. Makes my hair feel greasy, don't like the smell of it either. Affordable, but I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Took a gamble on it and threw it in the garbage after a few attempts with it	negatif
2343	18625423	Hate the smell but that’s because I don’t like the smell of roses. Anyway, I did not like at all. Doesn’t make my hair look wavy plus it gets all tangled after a little while.	negatif
2344	15585537	Sorry but this is a big No for me, I don't like the smell is too strong and sweet, it's a cloying scent, it's a citrus scent but it's not pleasant, the fragance last a lot but I really don't like this perfume. 	negatif
2345	17793772	I really don't like this smell from bath and body works. I'm not saying that it stinks, I just don't particularly care for these kind of smells. I don't ever want to smell like a piece of pumpkin or marshmallow. <br />	negatif
2346	1282415	I have extremely dry skin, so I was looking for a tinted moisturizer that I could quickly throw on for days that I want to leave the house, but not for anything important (just running errands and such). This product is not a moisturizer at all, but is simply a very thin foundation. Call me crazy, but I would expect a tinted moisturizer to have, I don't know, moisture in it. This is drier than my regular foundation, ripped up my skin when I put it on, looks terrible, and smelled like a distillery. I can't quite place it but it has the most god-awful chemical smell to it. All around, very disappointed with this product.	negatif
2347	2748510	Bad smell and short lasting	negatif
2348	1323403	Bad Smell,Bad Taste,Greasy For starters my skin is neural skin condition. I do love Burts bees, I buy it almost exclusively for my lip balm since my lips tend to be dry but I recently bought the under eye mask and the lip mask. Both of these masks were so unbelievably full of grease. I feel like my face will burst full of pimples because of the amount of grease from the masks. My phone screen is smudged from the amount of grease in these products. I know people will think I'm over exaggerating but Ive never had a product be so disgustingly greasy in my whole life. I really hope I bought a defective product instead of this being the final product	negatif
2349	1118559	This shampoo was either fake or old. The shampoo itself did not smell like Awapuhi, and the lettering was coming off the bottle. Returned.	negatif
2350	3145046	This does not smell like Samsara or last any length of time as a EDP should! I should know I have been wearing Samsara for years.	negatif
2351	5996774	This perfume arrived without a box and does not smell like knowing I have used knowing for years and this is not it!! Buyer beware	negatif
2352	5780475	Pretty sure this is fake, does not smell like the others I have purchased from the shops, will be returning it.	negatif
2353	3108596	This perfume does not smell like the real thing and the smell only lasts a few minutes. I suspect its counterfeit.	negatif
2354	2496834	This perfume does not smell like in Boots, and the smell does not last. Very disappointed, would rather buy in shop from now on.	negatif
2355	2829012	I have used Caron for over 30 yearsThis does not smell like any other Caron I have hadI wonder why?	negatif
2356	4764184	I wanted to like it but the smell was really awful. Thankfully the night cream does not smell like this.	negatif
2357	5936671	I have been waiting forever for this. it does not smell like the original. or even close to it. I want to cry.	negatif
2358	19333969	I normally buy the EDT for my husband but decided to try this instead. This does NOT smell like the BVL aftershave. Very disappointed.	negatif
2359	2389686	Very disappointed. Does not smell like the real thing. Perhaps they changed the formula. Would not buy again.	negatif
2360	2379320	unfortunately this was fake! did not smell like the real thing, no where near as strong and had a wierd smell to it. very disappointed	negatif
2361	22424578	Not sure if its genuine. Not impressed with smell, does not smell like after5. I would not recommend.	negatif
2362	22941704	This is fake. Not sealed. Really strong chemical smell and not waterproof!	negatif
2363	19224501	Really strong chemical smell, hard to remove eye makeups and it stings.	negatif
2364	5068333	This dry shampoo does the job however, the scent of awful. I've used it all of two times. First time was okay, second time was awful. The scent so overpowering that it gave me a migraine. Do not buy this dry shampoo even if you are a little bit sensitive to scents.	negatif
2365	1895683	It does not smell like the original perfum which I have been using for the last 25 years and five minutes after you spray it does not smell at all on your skin.	negatif
2366	5155437	I've worn this fragrance since Sephora first started selling it, but for the last few months, every bottle I have purchased STINKS. The new smell when it dries gives me a headache. It used to be sweet and light and now it's an overpowering floral/chemical smell. Like bug spray. Here's hoping they change it back or I will have to move on to a different fragrance after 9 years of wearing this one. Such a shame since I got soooooo many compliments on it.	negatif
2367	1142239	DONT BUT THIS FROM THIS SELLER! I have been using this cream for a long time, but only buying it from the Clinique counter in the department store. This arrived looking correct in the normal box and container. When I opened it I knew something was wrong. It’s was a different color (less white) and didn’t smell the same. Once I put it on, I knew instantly that it was a fraud. It didn’t feel the sam or work the same.	negatif
2368	6088283	To start I have dry sensitive skin. I used this after applying my shiseido ibuki moisturizer. Used it a total of 4 times (2 mornings and 2 nights) and they decided to stop when I noticed tightness around my cheeks (most dry and sensitive part of my face) and red bumps just above my cheekbones. It didn't smell nice, but that didn't bother me much. It did make some parts of my face feel softer, but not overall.	negatif
2369	13773797	HOT TAKE: Jackie J said it best when she said it smells like sweat. I lost my sample and I keep trying to look for it but then I think-- do I WANT to cover myself in sweat water? No. So, it can be in my trash for all I care. I am glad I didn't smell like someone else's BO for more than one time and didn't spend REAL money and just Sephora points. Save yourself the money!!!!!!!!!!!	negatif
2370	16240371	I find that over the years many of The Body Shop products have changed. The strawberry perfume actually contains a form of coconut oil (which I am allergic to) as well as an horrible amount of alcohol (you can smell it when you spray the perfume) . The strawberry perfume never contained coconut oil or alcohol in the past and I was an avid buyer of the strawberry perfume. Once the product changed it was too much of a risk to use (it also didn't smell the same anymore)	negatif
2371	19980792	I received this for free for testing, and I'm disappointed to say that I really didn't like it. I looked forward to receiving it, but once I tried it the first thing I noticed was the smell. It definitely didn't smell great. Then it left my hair feeling like a coat was left on. My normal curlier hair was made flatter, and lifeless looking after using these products. It also took twice as long to comb my hair after my shower, probably from the coat left on my hair.	negatif
2372	4874651	I received a sample of this from Influenster and was so excited to try it. tender romance sounds just like the type of fragrance i'd like to walk around wearing. However, it gave me a headache within minutes of putting it on (I stupidly didn't smell before I dabbed a bit on my neck and wrists). It smells too floral, too synthetic, and it just doesn't gel with my personal scent at all. I wouldn't purchase nor would i recommend.	negatif
2373	17281903	I bought this last minute for prom last year. I was looking for a nice nude lip gloss that went well with my dress and the color was perfect. When I got home and got all my makeup done I put this lip gloss on and instantly loved the color, but it became very sticky and gross on my lips. It was hard to get off and didn't smell that great. Won't be buying again	negatif
2374	25327152	Not my cup of tea I was hoping to discover something in this set that would blow me away and potentially become my new favorite scent to wear, however, that was sadly was not the case. These just didn't smell good to me. They were either too fruity or too musky. Perhaps they just don't mesh well with my body chemistry or whatnot but whatever the case may be, I am not a fan. I will be returning them and be on the hunt for something else instead.	negatif
2375	5078661	I HATE this perfume! I purchased it online so I didn't smell it first. I put it on one day and could not stand the smell. It has a peppery smell. I could not wait to get to work to try and wash it off. Worst perfume I've ever tried. I realize perfume is an individual taste thing but this one is just nasty. I usually wear florals or spice perfumes but not this one.	negatif
2376	7425338	This product is pretty cheap compared to other concealers.. I've had pretty good experiences with other products by this brand so I figured I'd give the concealer a shot.. I bought some from my local dollar store and applied it as I apply other concealers.. it didn't smell very pleasant.. in didn't blend into my skin as easily as other concealers.. it felt kind greasy too.. not sure if I got a bad batch or what not but I didn't like this product overall..	negatif
2377	944520	Absorbs Quickly,Goes On Smoothly,Long Lasting,Moisturizes Well,Not Greasy Bad Smell Twice daily after washing face morning and night. The smell was soooo overwhelming it made me dizzy and nauseous that I had to go and wash it off.	negatif
2378	945088	Bad Smell,Irritating Used this for a week and my skin has never looked so terribly. Breakout on my nose and chin, and I never get breakouts!! Plus the smell is overwhelming! Why on earth would you want to put something so fragrant on their face?!	negatif
2379	5099054	This kept separating on my skin by end of day. It looked gorgeous and fresh and flawless when first applied but unfortunately didn't wear well through the day. I have normal/dry skin. Also it is strongly fragranced which I don't like. It's an ok foundation but the price is not worth it, for me. Too bad, I really wanted to like it.	negatif
2380	4837941	This is a very strongly fragranced day cream with SPF 20. It doesn't layer well with any of wide range of products I use during the day. It also feels very greasy and overall I have no desire to use it ever. Also, don't misunderstand greasy for moisturizing. This makes me an oil slick but my skin does not appear or feel moisturized without using my usual moisturizers with it.	negatif
2381	19648480	Awful scent. Did not grab on to any oils in my hair.	negatif
2382	1282500	Cleans Thoroughly,Gentle Smells Bad The worst lab created chemical scent throughout this line.	negatif
2383	6189947	Words can barely describe how much I don't like this product. Let's start with the smell...this product is heavily perfumed and the scent does NOT dissipate over time. The first time I used this I spent the rest of the day trying to figure out what that awful smell was that I couldn't get away from. Moving forward from the overwhelming odor, I found the product itself to be tacky, and it left my hair feeling gross and gunky. 10 out of 10 would not repurchase, and I actually returned the one I did purchase.	negatif
2384	4747838	I got the travel size in Canvas, and for a lack of better words, it was an utter disappointment. The applicator was far too weak to even attempt to apply the product. The product itself is terrible also - bad smell, awful texture, does not go on evenly, comes off every time you drink or eat. I was left with a very patchy look. Had to remove an hour into my day.	negatif
2385	5120916	This smells awful. The smell lingers all day and is overpowering. Seriously can't wait to wash my hair, feels gritty, stinks, and left a major white cast. Even if you liked the way this smelled you would not be able to use this dry shampoo and wear any type of perfume. Just gross.	negatif
2386	24663444	Awful! This is the only negative review I've written on Sephora, but if I could give this product less than 1 star, I would! A deluxe sample of this was in the Christmas calendar, and I tried it today. When i opened the jar and saw and smelled it, i checked online to make sure it wasn't a foot cream! It was thick, waxy feeling, and had a strong unpleasant chemical smell. As an Ole fan, i tried it anyway. It was very hard to spread, and once on my face the smell was worse! About 5 minutes later, I had to wash my face to get the product off. My skin felt dry and itchy, and I couldn't get away from the smell!! Awful!!	negatif
2387	1396297	This leave-in conditioner just doesn't do much of anything. My hair doesn't smell of anything after putting it on, and doesn't look any different. I couldn't see any effect.You can grab any leave-in conditioner of any average to low price-range brand and have the same result. Really, it's a good bet you'd have the same result if you used a regular conditioner as a leave-in as well. This product just contains some supposedly healthy oil and a bunch of ingredients you'll find in any average off-the-shelf regular conditioner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2388	1278806	I’ve own a bottle of Gucci Guilty that was bought on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship...definitely the real deal. Upon opening this product I noticed right off the bat that the bottle is not the right color or texture. The real deal has a smooth, shiny dark gray/almost black bottom half - this one is light gray, textured, and not shiny. The seam at the bottom of this bottle has shoddy craftsmanship. The serial number on the bottle doesn’t match the box. The logo with the arrows is not authentic. It doesn’t smell quite the same either. Close, but definitely not the same. Avoid this product if you want the real thing!	negatif
2389	5067928	oily, smells bad. I used to use Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel when it was in a glass bottle. I drifted away and was using other brands for a while but decided to give it a try again. I was bummed when I saw that they changed the packaging to plastic. The first thing that stood out to me was how much the lotion smelled like petroleum. It also feels very heavy and sticky on my skin. I have sensitive, combination skin and don't feel that it benefits or harms my complexion but I'm going to return it and try something a little lighter that doesn't smell. Sorry, Clinique... I like your price point but you lost me on this one.	negatif
2390	24668732	"Does nothing EXCEPT... It makes your eyelashes fall out!! I got a deluxe sample of this in a kit from Sephora last month and have tried using this eye cream at night several times... And nearly every time I notice at least a few eyelashes on my face the next morning! I have never had this happen with an eye cream. I wanted to give it a chance to see if it was a ""one off"" too, but it doesn't appear to be. On top of that, it truly does NOTHING to improve the under eye area. About the only good thing I can say about it is it doesn't smell (because so many Caudal products DO!) and it feels nice on. But it really is a useless eye cream!"	negatif
2391	1901054	If you are buying this under the impression that it is the same as L'Oreal's other Extraordinary Oil Shampoo, don't be mistaken. It is absolutely no substitute for the other stuff. My hair has gone from being smooth, soft and manageable to brittle and frizzy. It's like straw. I've had to substitute another brand of shampoo altogether to get it back to a decent state and I'm incredibly disappointed.Also, this shampoo doesn't smell like the old kind, and nowhere near as good. It's inferior in literally every way and I cannot advise against buying it enough.	negatif
2392	13905721	I've used a lot of heat protectants in my day, but I would have to say this one is definitely NOT the best. It makes your hair very hard and stiff, which makes it VERY hard to straighten or curl. It makes your hair feel very dirty and heavy, which I really don't like. It's also hard to wash off, and the fragrance that's added doesn't work, because it doesn't smell good. The price is great but thr e product is not. I wouldn't recommend this. This formula also takes very long to dry, and it makes your hair pretty sticky. I would go for another brand.	negatif
2393	5523055	So underwhelmed with these products, after reading good reviews.The shampoo smells nice, but when I was washing my hair it didn't feel clean and there was a film left on it, even after two washes.The conditioner doesn't smell as nice, but it did seem to improve on the dryness of my hair (hence the one star).I did persevere with using these hoping I would be proved wrong. However, the result left my hair limp and very greasy after a day of washing. For the high price tag I am utterly disappointed, as they are unusable.I went and bought some herbal essences instead, and I was a happy lady!	negatif
2394	5175503	I had heard great things about it but it just didn't work out for me in the end. The sunscreen is greasy and doesn't smell pleasant. It did leave a white cast during the initial application but the more you rub the product into the skin it does go away. The smell goes away after about an hour or so as well. Unless I wash my face within a few hours of using this sunscreen, my forehead breaks out like crazy at the end of the day. I'm very unhappy because I really do like tarte's products but this sunscreen didn't do it for me :/ I will probably save it to use on the rest of my body but it's staying away from my face.	negatif
2395	4908468	While this product might seem innovative and exciting, it's got huge misgivings. First, the idea of sitting in the shower for five minutes while this absorbs... very unappealing. I was just standing in the shower, dripping and freezing, with the water turned off. It doesn't make a lot of sense in reality. Then, you can't tell where the product is going because it's very pale, so you don't know where you're putting it. It doesn't smell good, and also I didn't see any results and I used this three times. Overall, it's very inconvenient and difficult to use. This is an example of when cutting corners really does not work!	negatif
2396	4814574	I regret buying this product because I don't understand how it works on skin. Upon application on clean washed skin, my skin feel it is covered with thick layer of paste that doesn't smell nice, to say the least. The worse thing is that it doesn't help my skin to hydrate. After I wash it off, my skin does not change at all in texture, plumpness... So I am not sure how it is supposed to do wonder to skin... won't be repurchasing it and don't recommend it. My skin is combination oily and sensitive.	negatif
2397	2010591	Very disappointed in this perfume, was at the end of a bottle that I'd purchased from The Perfume Shop didn't have time to go back purchase again so thought I'd save time and purchase this online, but it doesn't smell the same, it's very musky smelling it's like there's an ingredient missing it doesn't have the sweet smell of the perfume I've just finished, and its sent doesn't last as long either. I love this perfume and would purchase again just not from here.	negatif
2398	5653618	I bought this for my mum as a mother's day present. It's one of her favourite perfumes. My mum informed me that there was something wrong with the smell, that it doesn't smell like it normally does/should and that the smell didn't last. I checked the code stamped on the base of the bottle and on the base of the box and discovered that it had been manufactured 2 years previously - you can check codes online. I have no idea how the perfume has been stored in the warehouse over the past 2 years, but it doesn't smell like the previous bottle my mum still has. If you can buy one that's new stock then you should be ok.	negatif
2399	19853254	First of all, I think mine arrived oxidized since it was dark orange when I got it. Second of all, I saw someone online refer to the smell of this as smelling like hot dogs, and omg - IT DOES. And tbh, I just really don't want to put anything that smells like hot dogs on my face! You'd think, for the price, they could maybe play around with altering the scent a bit so it doesn't smell so strongly of hot dogs, lol. If the smell doesn't bother you and your product doesn't arrive oxidized, you might like this product, but for those two reasons I was unable to really give this product a good try and wouldn't try it again in the future.	negatif
2400	1338009	It's a great idea to make one fragrance for both sexes, so naturally I tried it on both myself and my other half. I don't find the fragrance very long lasting and doesn't smell much when swatched. Although wearing the fragrance on myself smelt really overly musky and a little like wet dog.. Not nice! On my partner it didn't really smell of anything or at least nothing notable. For £35 I wouldn't rate it as good value. If you prefer strong musky smells then it's great but I much prefer sweet scents.	negatif
2401	11473656	I do not like this perfume I think it has a weird smell I only got a sample from and one of my Sephora purchases but I don't like the scent it's a little too floral and I don't know I like the bottle but it's a little too overpriced for what it really is I think there's a wreck room for	negatif
2402	11671643	I personally did not like it at all for my hair. Made it feel and look greasy. I don't like the scent and the active ingredients that make hair healthy are really non existent or at the bottom of the list of the ingredients. Which means their is nearly enought to make a difference. I wouldn't purchase . I have colored hair blonde to be exact mid back length	negatif
2403	5211354	I bought this product to use when I wanted a nice glow to my skin without wearing foundation. After applying, there was absolutely no difference. I can't say how it works if you want as a primer under foundation but if you are looking to use for a nice glow to a bare face, this is a waste of money. Also don't like the scent.	negatif
2404	23337855	I bought this because I loved the purple bottle from this brand but this just feels like cheap oil that makes me break out . It doesn’t feel like it sinks into my skin and hydrates it just sits on top and feels oily. I don’t like the scent either the purple one smells amazing. Not worth the money and not worth the break outs	negatif
2405	1269132	Have used this shampoo for a long time and the product I got from Amazon was definitely not authentic Bumble and Bumble. This product is more like dishwashing soap. Bubbled up like crazy, doesn’t smell like the real stuff. Would never buy from Amazon again. Awful when you want the convenience of purchase but don’t get the real stuff. Recommend buying from salon.	negatif
2406	1836775	It appears that, like so many others, this has been reformulated and so now, it doesn't smell like the original - there is something missing. The sillage isn't good either, I can hardly smell it on my husband unless he's right next to me and the fragrance doesn't last long either. Wouldn't buy again.	negatif
2407	6961749	I bought this product at Sephora and I heard great things. This mascara is beyond ordinary, doesn't smell good at all and the brush is just like drug store brands. Too much hype not what I expected and is pretty pricey. I returned the mascara. The packaging is nice I'll give you that and clever name but not worth the money.	negatif
2408	6067727	This just doesn't smell good on me. Oranges smell like cleaning products to me in fragrances and while this is pretty at first it's really more like air freshener for your skin. And then it disappears completely. I mixed this with water and used the sample I got from my play box as room spray instead. I like Atelier Cologne a lot but this was a big miss for me.	negatif
2409	9092899	This body butter keeps me moisturized but when it comes to scent i find that it really irritates my nose. It just doesn't smell good at all to me. I gave it to my friend who seems to like it but for me it wasn't that good of a product. I might buy it again but only as a gift.	negatif
2410	24846628	The worst loose powder I have tried. It is so finely milled you open the lid and the powder flies up into the air which you end up breathing in (doesn't smell nice) once on the skin it oxidises your concealer and makes it look orange. It also looks incredibly dry and cakey on the skin, so would recommend you pass on this product.	negatif
2411	13191052	I tried this product for 30 days and I saw no change. It burned my eyes, made me feel like I had sticky candy on my face, and it doesn't smell very good. I would not recommend. My review was so poor after testing it I chose not even to share. I was not happy with my results or the way it reacted to my skin.	negatif
2412	23789859	I received this in a voxbox and I do not like it. It is so hard to rinse out. It doesn't smell good. I tried it when I first got it and I thought it was ok but I decided to try it again. It was so hard to get out of my hair. I hated how my hair smelled and it made some of my hair fall out. Ugh.	negatif
2413	19530850	the bottle is too big, too snappy to open, doesn't smell that great and the taurine in it had no effect on me. Didn't lather, overall for what would be classed as a premium product I'm disappointed and would not make a purchase myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2414	2878027	this perfume was not sealed in a cellophane as it should be if it is new and un-used. Feels too light for a supposed to be new bottle of perfume. Plus my wife has the same perfume but as it is almost finish she went to buy this but she said it doesn't smell the same. Not very happy wife with this purchase	negatif
2415	3365882	I chose the one that was cheapest across all sellers but it turned out to be fake. The existing one smelled great and lasted for at least 6 to 8 hours inside office and about 3 - 4 hrs while in the sun. However this bottle purchased in Amazon doesn't smell as good and doesn't last for more than an hour.Complained to Amazon. Awaiting their response.	negatif
2416	2399640	Disappointed with this,I like others suspect this is fake,it has put me off buying perfumes or aftershave off Amazon in future. Am considering sending it back.it arrived without cellophane wrapper,and just doesn't smell right,smells soapy,as others have said.buyer beware!!!	negatif
2417	18601297	I'm glad that I didn't buy the full size of this. The smell is really strong in a bad way and doesn't smell natural at all. It also dries very fast and hurts? Within 10 seconds of application it starts stinging, tingling, and feels like I'm getting pricked by needles.	negatif
2418	15035359	I bought the travel size online to fulfill a coupon requirement. If I had been able to smell it in person, I would not have ordered. It really doesn't smell like anything, just soapy chemicals. I'm not sure what I thought it would smell like, but I expected something better than this.	negatif
2419	5181167	I wanted to love this product and I had high hopes but I used it for a couple days and it made me break out horribly :( it was the only thing I changed in my skincare routine and I'm currently having a hard time getting my skin back to normal. My skin is slightly oily. Doesn't smell very good but usually that doesn't matter to me.	negatif
2420	12709041	This is a physical sunscreen, as expected, it leaves white cast on my face, which I very dislike. The texture is thick and oily, and sticky once applied. It doesn't smell pleasantly either. After 1 month of continuously usage, a lot of small white heads appear onto my face. No better than any drugstore sunscreen, even tho it priced $15+	negatif
2421	23339683	I feel like this does nothing for my skin as a primer. And as a setting spray, it only makes me look oily. Not dewy, but OILY. Didn’t set my makeup well. Also has a citrusy smell that just doesn’t smell good- reminds me of a house cleaner. I’ll stick to my beloved Smashbox Photo Finish Primer water!	negatif
2422	17000509	I hate this soap. It has a very plastic like scent to me, it just doesn’t smell pleasant. I also don’t think it cleans my sponges and brushes very well. I prefer to use a solid soap as those seem to take makeup out of my sponges immediately. When using this I feel like I have to use a lot of the product to get anything clean.	negatif
2423	23019068	This product has many faults. firstly- the stinging!! It’s feels like something is vibrating on your lip and it’s very uncomfortable! Secondly it has little or no pigment. Just a little bit of sparkle. Thirdly it doesn’t smell nice. It’s very sickly sweet. Thank goodness it came in a 70% off set!	negatif
2424	5933336	Obviously I wanted to try this product because of all the great reviews... and I understand it's not for everyone. So I bought it.. tried it.... and hate it.. the smell is what's bothering me the most... to me it doesn't smell good. And I was disappointed of the shine that I received. It's going back	negatif
2425	4744879	foamy, drying. Returned this stuff a week after purchasing. Very frothy and foamy when washing, but also slightly irritating. After rinsing it off and drying with a towel, it felt like I had a mask on it was so dry. Left a gross film all over my face. Do not recommend. (Also doesn't smell great)	negatif
2426	18625514	Absolutely horrible. Left my hair looking wet, greasy looking, and dirtier, even when all I needed was a little touch up. Only good thing about it is that it doesn’t smell horrible and it looks cute when you spray it. Added no volume, just dampened my hair down. Would not recommend to anyone!!!	negatif
2427	5655961	I have worn this for a number of years and am extremely disappointed with this purchase. Seems fake. Doesn't smell the same and fragrance doesn't last at all. I persevered with it for a couple of months but have since purchased another bottle from one of my usual retailers. The difference is obvious as the new one smells and lasts as normal.	negatif
2428	3056598	Was this genuine? Does aftershave have a use by date? As this doesn't smell anything like my last bottle and has a funny smell which I can't place, like plastercine! I've never wrote a review ever but felt the need to say this has put me off buying aftershave online again. The last 4 bottles from Amazon was great but this was worse than poor	negatif
2429	3102715	I foolishly bought this product, thinking I'd save £30 pounds on the price I normally pay at debenhams. BAD move, it doesn't smell a bit like the one I've bought from debenhams. So let's recap..... 1) false economy, 2) To good to be true,and finally 3) sucker!!	negatif
2430	5994016	Sunflowers has always been a favourite of mine so was disappointed to find this latest purchase a waste of money. It doesn't smell quite right as I remember it and faded after just a few minutes,Although the packaging and bottle looks right I feel it might well be a fake.My advice is ....Don't buy.	negatif
2431	3108432	This is not the genuine perfume. I've been buying this for many years and it doesn't smell the same and it doesn't last at all. It's not a horrible smell but it's certainly not the genuine fragrance so I'm really annoyed and I should have listened to the other negative reviews instead of trying the get a bargain. A total waste of money.	negatif
2432	8616885	i don't like this product, the smell is so strong and it doesn't smell good, i don't really like it, i bought it online, it's so disappointing. i'm a repeating user, i wanted to give it a second chance but i'm not recommending, nope, disgusting 	negatif
2433	19986641	Hated this product because it broke me out after the first use. It doesn’t smell very nice either. AND THE PRICE. It isn’t worth the price at all because it doesn’t last that long because it’s freshly made. I wouldn’t recommend this if you have sensitive oily combination skin.	negatif
2434	8259201	This product is a bit disappointing, the lip stain doesn't smell very nice and is very hard to apply, also the colour isn't pigmented at all, the only thing it does do is it adds a very small layer of moisture, the packaging however is very eye catching, I wouldn't recommend this.	negatif
2435	6212593	sticky, smells awful. first of all, no this doesn't smell amazing it smells like old lady cloyingly sweat roses. secondly, this makes my hair crunchy and stringy. the only way to make it work is to brush it through after and then it just falls flat again. i've tried drug store beach sparys that work better than this.	negatif
2436	13297689	If I could rate it NO STARS I would. This has done NOTHING for me and a tried so hard to like it. I know my masks and I love my masks and I particularly HATE this one. It is a complete waste of money. I hate the texture. It smells VERY CHEMICALLY like BATHROOM CLEANER it doesn't smell natural at all. THE WORST.	negatif
2437	23383572	I was a bit dubious about trying this product as it mentioned the words 'bleach'. But as the packaging stated the dye contained 60% oils and no ammonia I thought this must be more of a natural product, I wish I had trusted my instincts! The dye was quite hard to apply, and the mixture was very wet making application a bit messy even with help. Once the dye was removed, I wanted to cry. I was left with patchy yellow, orange and white hair with a few black stripes (I'm naturally light brown so have NO idea where they came from). Not to mention how awful the condition was, my hair looked and felt like straw. The colour was nowhere near what was shown on the box, in my opinion the end result is MUCH more yellowy and cheap looking. I planned on sharing a picture of the results but couldn't bring myself to share the embarrassment. I had to dye my hair again that same day with another blonde colour, luckily this covered most of the yellow tone although it is still tinged at the roots. On the plus side, the dye didn't smell strongly and didn't burn my scalp but other than that I would NOT recommend this hair dye. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2438	5925374	I have dry skin and I do experience hormonal break outs. I am always on the look out for new hydrating moisturizers, especially if they cost less than my current cream (I use PTR's Water Drench cream). I am so happy I got a sample of this with my last order because I would've been upset about spending money on a product that was a complete failure for me. First off, the gel texture didn't absorb into my skin. It kind of just sat on my face and left my face feeling goopy. Second, the scent wasn't something I was excited about it. It just didn't smell good to me. Lastly, and most importantly, this product caused me to break out--badly! By the end of the day, I had all these tiny bumps all over my forehead and along the side of my face. That was the only new product I used that day. This happened about 4 days ago. For the most part, the bumps have disappeared, except for a small portion on my forehead. I am so glad I tried this out via a sample instead of actually buying the product.	negatif
2439	20327130	"Scent is wayyyyyyyyyy too strong and overwhelming. Bothers me the entire day, it's not a bad scent but just not one I'd like to smell. Not sure if it even does the trick, rather just wash my hair. Purchased the dry shampoo at Sephora. Not sure if the one I purchased is the same, as my bottle does not have ""lush scent"" printed at the top."	negatif
2440	17627925	It’s way too strong smell and it burns your lips like no other and it can be quite greasy	negatif
2441	11408774	Too strong smell, and the finish of the product is not nice, transfers easily and the colors are tacky... I would not recommend it	negatif
2442	5419240	this goes on SO uneven. I have bought this 3 times and all of the spray head have some kind of problem, my mac fix + goes on beautifully, the spray head is great in my fix +... but this?? it goes on horrible. And it doesn't help me at all. SOOO EXPENSIVE. I don't like the smell. I will buy the all nighter next time	negatif
2443	1343720	I bought this as I loved the original version of it and had used it for over 20 years. But so disappointed with new one. Don't like the smell at all, it leaves a residue and it no where near as nice as the original version. I will now have to find something else to usePlease, please bring back the original version, it was SOOO much better.	negatif

2445	19817735	I did not love this serum. I don’t know if all of their products have the same floral scent, but I just really don’t like the smell of flowers and this serum smelled like I was rubbing flowers all over my face and it grossed me out. I wouldn’t purchase this, personally,	negatif
2446	13827890	"Aweful stuff especially if you are not a fan of coconut. Lasts a while if you don't like the smell I woule say. Pricey. I would never buy this product again. Used it once for a week. ""Giving it a chance."" I recommend it yes, but if you don't like coconut or are allergic, then don't buy."	negatif
2447	10595854	horrible just horrible, I personally really dislike this product. First, I don't like the smell. Next, I HATE the consistency of it, it makes my hair feel incredibly greasy and weighed down (and I already have excessively oily hair so I definately do not to add anymore grease to it.) The product is super cheap but still not worth the waste of money in my book.	negatif
2448	14784485	I use this to hold down fly hairs a lot and I have to say it make my hair feel very heavy a kind of hard to get it to keep volume but not fly away and I really don't like the smell of this product it reminds me of a really cheap shampoo and conditioner and it makes my hair get greasy way faster than normal no matter how little or how much I use.	negatif
2449	15579668	I received this and the conditioner via Influenster to sample. My hair is very oily so I have to wash my hair every day if not every other day. The shampoo dried my hair out so bad and even with the smallest amount of conditioner my hair became excessively oily. I don't like the smell or the way it leaves my hair.	negatif
2450	13028524	I have very dry skin and this primer leaves my face feeling oily. I can't wait until run out! I don't like the smell, don't like how it makes my skin look- don't even know if it works as a primer. Just know I won't be purchasing it again!	negatif
2451	13658789	I don't like this because it doesn't do much and it is very very thick and. I don't like thick creams like this one it makes my skin feel werid too wolhich I don't like and I don't like the smell or the price either it's not great and I would definitely not recommend to a friend 	negatif
2452	14182621	Broke out my skin. RIP. Honestly, I loved it until my skin looked like a war zone the next day. It's a sheer kind of coverage. I don't like the smell, but it's not that noticeable after it's been on you for a while. Unfortunately, after it made my skin cry I won't be repurchasing ever again.	negatif
2453	8708956	Ew! This is sticky and I don't like the smell. It smells like orange but not in a good way. I don't think this is refreshing and doesn't apply smooth to be used as a priming spray. I also felt that as a finishing spray it is not even coverage-it's spotty and like I said earlier, sticky. I returned this.	negatif
2454	5943293	I received a generous sample of this facial from Sephora and after one use, it's going in the garbage. It has a weird odor. It was so bad and so strong that after tossing and turning in bed I decided to get up and rewash my face. I guess there are others who don't like the smell either.	negatif
2455	23832086	This cleanser is very difficult to use as it easily dries out and is very, very hard to spread on your face. I don’t like the smell of the texture at all and would not recommend. I’m not sure if it’s effective as I’m not sure I ever figured out how to use it.	negatif
2456	1565593	I tried using this product a few times, but just don't like it. I don't like the smell - it smells very clinical, and it made me feel really uncomfortable afterwards, until I had washed off every trace. I tried without the product and found it much easier to relax and much less painful.	negatif
2457	23525792	Really don’t like the smell or taste of this, it makes me feel sick as it’s so strong. I have used this lots of times but don’t like it anymore. I like the concept of the packaging like the squeezy tube is handful so you don’t get it on your hands.	negatif
2458	14487529	I do not like this stuff at all. I find it does nothing for my lips if they are dry; I have to reapply constantly and I don't like the smell either. I'm usually not bothered by the scent of products but this seems very strong to me. I won't buy this again. The only upside is the price point	negatif
2459	15750483	Don't like this product. I don't like the texture as it's difficult to use and I really don't like the smell of this. Don't like using this as you have to use your finger to apply the product. I will not be purchasing this product any time soon.	negatif
2460	18729982	I really don’t like this lip balm I don’t like the smell, when it gets in your mouth it tastes awful, the product to me overall just doesn’t do the job.

This product is inexpensive and can be found in almost all drug stores grocery stores and dollar stores.Carmex Everyday Healing Lip Balm Jar	negatif
2461	17310009	Not a fan. I don't like the feeling of it on my lips, and I really don't like the smell. I find it difficult to apply because it doesn't spread nicely and just gloops on your lips! Although, in time of crisis, I would use this lipcare if i had to.	negatif
2462	6411159	i don't like the smell, they don't seem to work as well as cheaper makeup removing wipes and i have to use multiple wipes to remove liquid eyeliner. adds up with wipes and with the price of buying them - they are not worth it. i picked these up at walmart when my usual wipes were out of stock- i won't buy again 	negatif
2463	23441860	I don’t like the smell it really isn’t for me at all it’s to strong but what I don’t like some one else might like so it just all depends on u as a person I’m very picky when it comes to perfumes and I’m sure I’m. Not only one lol	negatif
2464	6199213	scented. This bottle is travel-sized, so it really is not good value, in my opinion. It also just doesn't work for me - it does not add volume or make my hair look less greasy. And I don't like the smell. I'll keep it and use it as a travel dry shampoo, but I won't repurchase.	negatif
2465	5417321	"for the price of this stuff i cannot believe how awful it smells. it is incredibly strong, even one spray is headache inducing. it takes hours for that ""strongness"" and sharpness to dissipate but even then, smells awful. somehow this scent manages to be both sweet and sharp-loud and overpowering. its awful."	negatif

2481	19643005	Stay Away! I have dry skin so I am always looking for rich and hydrating night masks to add into my skincare routine when my skin needs a lil' summin' summin' extra. Right off the bat this product smelled awful!!! The scent was overpowering and faux. Despite the smell I slathered a bunch on my face two hours before bed. Within 20 minutes I had an awful headache from the overpowering scent. Worst of all when I woke up I didn't notice any marked effect and my skin actually seemed less hydrated than when I do my normal routine.	negatif

2505	23023624	I received a generous sample of this from the BB counter. On the plus side, this moisturized and worked nicely under makeup, providing a very subtle glow. On the minus side, this product was so strongly fragranced that it gave me a headache! The fragrance would have been lovely in a room candle, but had no place on my face. If BB could eliminate the fragrance and add an SPF, this would be a home-run product for me.	negatif
2506	6064538	If there was some way to leave a 0 star review, I would do it in a heartbeat. I love plumping lip glosses, and I really wanted to like this. The color was pretty, the packaging was nice, the price point is fantastic, but the product itself was, in a word, HORRIBLE!!! There is an OVERPOWERING chemical smell that was so bad I couldn't bring myself to use this a second time. I ended up giving this away to someone who couldn't smell (how is that even possible?!!) the chemical nastiness. I should note that the strongly unpleasant smell dissipated quickly but not quickly enough for me. I'm very disappointed and would never recommend this to another human being. Ever.	negatif
2507	22703445	awful scent I really wanted to like the product based on the review but I can’t get past the awful scent. It smells like old laundry. And mixed with my serum and moisturizer creates even more awful scent. Maybe I received a old defective product but I need to return it.	negatif

2513	8903919	I didn't like this hair spray because it made my hair very crunch tabs I wanted a hairspray that wouldn't do that but it was very good smelling like you could smell this product in the hallways and it wouldn't don't smell like burnt hair from your curling iron or hair straightener	negatif
2514	13675268	Tarte Maracuja Bronzing serum which I don't like is the smell so strong . When I open the bottle and smell so strong which I can't stand it at all. I don't want to give it someone else will not the smell.:(	negatif
2515	14299551	I received this from Sephora as one of my 3 samples in the mail. So of course this didn't cost me money. The packaging is a little tricky to actually get the product out but that doesn't bother me too much. Unfortunately I don't like the musky smell of this perfume.	negatif
2516	6215526	I got a sample of this and everyone who is saying it smells like corn tortillas/tamales is absolutely right. Like I love those foods, but I don't wanna smell like them. Wouldn't buy.	negatif
2517	6016996	It really pains me to give a NYX product a bad review. I love so many products they make, but this was a complete and utter miss on all fronts.I had issues with both the formula and the colour. Istanbul looked so pretty online - a soft, pretty pink that would be a good everyday option. In reality it was way too cool for my skin and looked very severe. I think it was the combination of the flat and streaky finish with the blue undertones that made this look awful again my pale skin, Not flattering at all.The main formula issues I had with this product were:1. It had a really rancid smell and taste. I'm not normally too fussy when it comes to scented products, but this had an awful plasticky/chemical scent and it tasted very strange.2. I found it really hard to get an even application. It needed two layers to get rid of any bald spots and then it took a long time to dry down, meaning it was prone to smudging and transfer.I'll admit the formula did feel comfortable, but with all the other issues I wouldn't bother with this product again.	negatif
2518	8216810	It has a weird smell to it. Smell like chemical. Did not work for me. Taste weird to because of the chemical scent.	negatif
2519	20362096	Thiz dried out in less than a month. The smell of this mascara bothered me soo much. It has a very strong chemical scent.	negatif
2520	1886329	NYX products or any genuine makeup should not smell as chemically repellant as this. At first it seemed to just be a waxy/chemical smell but when I swirled my finger to swatch it on my hand the smell made me retch. There is no way this is a genuine product and I am surprised it is still for sale by amazon. This made me look on the NYX website and I looked at the product like for like. The colours look different and the packaging also. I have reported the item to Amazon and asked them to investigate. I have also received a full refund. I would be concerned for anyone to put this on their face. Many other reviews also reflect similar experiences.Thanks for reading :)	negatif
2521	5837718	highly scented. I cannot get past the overly strong fragrance of this shampoo. It lingers for hours and is strong enough for others to smell it too. I do not like the scent. It is overpowering to me. I used it a few times and then threw out the entire bottle.	negatif
2522	5419309	"I really don't know what other people are smelling when they smell Flowerbomb but when I smell it I just smell chemicals! Zero flowers, zero patchouli. Just a very strong, very unpleasant, sharp chemically odor. When I very first smelled it, years and years ago, in a magazine I remember thinking ""Wow! This is amazing! I need this!"" But when I finally smelled it in person it was like I was smelling a completely different fragrance. It didn't smell anything like I remembered. It was horrendous. I will never understand why this perfume is so popular but I'm assuming it must just smell different to me than to others which is too bad..."	negatif
2523	2008453	This product is almost certainly not the genuine article. It was a birthday present for my daughter and I was unaware of the problem until she removed the plastic wrapping around the box. We then discovered that the secret code from inside the box had been scratched away and the box had been tampered with and glued back together again (even though it was sealed with the plastic wrapping). The perfume didn't smell quite right, either. Perfume returned to Amazon for refund. I have since read other Amazon customer reviews and it seems that I am not the only one who had this problem.	negatif
2524	1958820	As other reviews suggest this is definitely not the real deal. I bought olaplex from the hairdressers and it was creamy and didn't smell strongly. This does not feel conditioning and sat in my bathroom cupboard for a while developed a strange odour and Looks of colour. I have only used it once and although it didn't affect my hair badly it gave no deep conditioning results that the original olaplex does. The original olaplex retails at 30 pounds so this price really is to good to be true because I assure you this is not genuine although the packaging could be very deceiving. The only place offering this product at such a discount is Amazon which further suggests that this is a copy of olaplex, but it defiently is not affective as the real thing.	negatif
2525	4849704	This was part of my free birthday gift. I'm glad it was free but the minute I opened it, I'd wished I'd picked the other choice. The soy cleanser was nice but this mask was horrible to smell. I tried it anyway. I couldn't take the smell so it didn't even last the 5 minutes. I don't know if it actually does what it's claiming as I couldn't get past the smell long enough. It reminded me of crushed rotting roses but didn't smell like a flower at all.	negatif
2526	4707925	I am disappointed - firstly, this didn't smell like vanilla at all (more of an herb scent perhaps?) and secondly, this didn't last the way I expected it to. I wore it at home while cleaning the house and had to reapply after four or five hours during a sniff check. I did wear it over top of a salt deodorant purely as a vain, pleasant scent booster. I'm glad I had my salt deo underneath or I'm sure this would have failed completely. I recommend this only for a lazy day and to purchase the trial size only if you're browsing for something new. Was very soft, might be good for the sensitive pits people.	negatif
2527	5889777	I wish I had read other reviews before purchasing. The item that was sold to me was not genuine. I had the authentic and genuine Vera Wang for men to compare which I had purchased at Heathrow Airport duty free last year. Looking at the box, there were slight variations between the genuine and non-genuine product. The real giveaway was the bottle cap - it should be made of wood and be textured. The product I received had a pale brown plastic cap. The final test came when I sprayed it, it was very weak and didn't smell anything like it should. I have been purchasing Vera Wang for men since it launched in 2004 and I can tell the difference straight away. Amazon refunded me as the seller was a Prime seller.	negatif
2528	6284970	After washing my hair in the fabulous Shampoo i expected the same Luxurious feeling from the Conditioner, wrong! The conditioner was a very different texture and smell to the Shampoo. The appearance was almost like a clear Gel that didn't smell very nice. I would not associate the conditioner with the word 'Luxurious'. I didn't feel the conditioner left my hair feeling soft, if anything it felt quite coarse and not well conditioned.I would continue to use the Shampoo but i would team this up with a different conditioner. Not for me unfortunately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2529	16339612	Too strong scent always itch after I've used it and I don't have sensitive skin. I find it oily compared to other brands too	negatif
2530	19647568	Extremely Drying I have really dry cuticles and am always on the hunt for something that actually works. This product is awful!!! The scent of alcohol is overwhelming when you open the bottle. I may as well be putting a combo of water and alcohol on my cuticles. It does nothing to help them--they remain super dry and raggedy. This is a complete waste of money and I'm so disappointed since I usually love Formula X products.	negatif
2531	5418825	I have gotten many samples of this from sephora including a large tube and it's just too greasy for me. Doesn't help minimize the look of my large pores very much (if at all) and my makeup slides right off when I use this. I also don't like the scent. I have found that clinique pore refining solutions serum works much better than this if you have oily skin and want something to help the appearance of pores (temporarily) plus is good for your skin.	negatif
2532	10985807	Sorry I don't like this scent it smells like an old sandalwood that was left out in the sun for years. I received this product in my Birchbox I believe and my friend has this also and she didn't like it either but that's our opinion but hey you might like this scent to each is own maybe if you try it out you'll like it. This will be a great gift giver to my friend who loves oils and will love this...	negatif
2533	6804930	I don't like the Dove Deep Moisture Hydration Body Wash because I don't like the scent it comes in. It has a medicinal smell to it and it reminds me of the hospital. I will say it does foam up fairly good and rinses off easily. The price is comparable to other store brands but I just couldn't get past the scent. I haven't tried the other scents because this one turned me off of this particular body wash.	negatif
2534	11113341	I got this as a sample when I did an online make up order. This is not something I would wear. It is strong and over powering. It has a strong floral scent which I choose never to wear because I don't like the scent. I do like that it came in a spray. I think when you get a sample you need a spray to be able to wear it like you would if you bought the product.	negatif
2535	4947521	I don't like this scent at all. I don't consider it unique, just odd. A strange mix of flowers and sweet. I think people rage over it because of the brand, not the scent. It's one of the lower cost scent. Most of Tom Ford's scent start over $200, but you can get this for as low as $45, so it's an affordable way to say, I wear Tom Ford.	negatif
2536	4882279	just overwhelming ugh.	negatif
2537	1479569	I have used Pureology Hydrate for several years now. I liked the description of the “sheer” not weighing hair down, but still providing moisture. Unfortunately, this left my hair a staticky, gross mess! I have also questioned it’s authenticity as it doesn’t smell or feel like my other product. Spend the time to drive to a salon to get the real deal and to ensure that it can be returned if you don’t like it!	negatif
2538	4806093	I'm not sure if something is wrong with the particular bottle I purchased or my nose, but after reading other people's reviews something is up. The hair mist doesn't smell the slightest bit fresh and/or floral to me. It smells like grandma farts. It's a strong muskie smell that might be suitable for having a wine spritzer with Nana before you hit the bingo hall, but that's about it.	negatif
2539	5241025	Bought this concealer as my first concealer from Sephora, and as soon as I opened it I smelled very pungent chemicals. The shade lightest enough for me was very yellow and unnatural, overall it's the smell that really got to me. I used it to cover up blemishes and it stung but with nars concealer (that doesn't smell like chemicals) felt totally fine. Makes you wonder what you're putting under your eyes every morning!!	negatif
2540	5088106	I was really excited to receive this palette and was hoping that the quality was going to be as good as the original too faced palettes. To my disappointment, the quality of this palette is horrible; there's no pigmentation, it had a ton of fall out, and very chalky. The packaging itself is bad compared to the other palettes, and it doesn't smell at all like it was advertised. I'm definitely returning this palette, it's not even worth regifting.	negatif
2541	6069489	Stick to what you normally use to set your makeup. Yes I do wear the primer cream to start off putting my makeup on, but this is another story. When I was done it sprayed out crazy and I thought I was going to have to wash my face and start over. Doesn't smell good and feels like I got sprayed with a garden hose. And yes, I was holding it correctly. Love the regular primer and will continue to purchase, just not the spray 3-1.	negatif
2542	18562257	The product I received was not the same as the Armani Mania I have been purchasing for over 13 years!! It doesn't smell the same when I sprayed it on and the colour of the perfume was a dark orange colour not the light peach colour it should be. This is my favourite perfume and sorry to say this isn't it!!0Comment| One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Report abuseCommentInsert product link	negatif
2543	22573890	Nope, nope, nope. Bought this on a whim because it’s a great brand and the Ulta employee raved about it. I literally only used it for THREE mornings/nights and I had under the skin, huge, painful zits. Stopped using and skin was back to normal. Check the ingredients, why does it need fragrance? Doesn’t smell good anyway! Not good for sensitive skin. Returned to Ulta!	negatif
2544	4753357	Just recieved this fragrance, and I am definitely returning it. When I first sprayed one spritz, the entire room smelled of it. I sprayed it on my wrist and let it dry for 15 minutes, and the smell is really light, but it's one of those smells you could find anywhere. It smells very young, like childhood young. Great for a tween, but not for $50. The fragrance doesn't smell worth the price AT ALL. Not good. My wrist smells like a ten year olds perfume.	negatif
2545	3119438	I think this is a counterfeit batch as I've also received one that doesn't smell like the original, I've been to Debenhams to compare and howcome their testers last all day yet this bottle does no justice? Completely gutted as I thought it was a decent price for a great scent! This is the 3rd counterfeit bottle I have purchased from Amazon. I think the best idea is to pay the full whack in a retail store	negatif
2546	6212692	I purchased it because of the bottle, but it doesn't smell good. I tried to like it, but it reminded me of a reed diffuser I use for my bathroom. My boyfriend sighed relief when I told him I was returning it. He said it smells like talcum powder and reminded him of an older woman. Definitely not what the black stiletto represents. I wish it smelled better. It dries down to a cheap drugstore scent.	negatif
2547	23321582	Not So Great My hair is pretty dark, long, and has a tendency to get oily and flaky. With this dry shampoo, it did absorb oil, but not leaving it feeling refreshed. Tarte's Hair Goals dry shampoo get a little grease on my scalp leaving flakes of the product on other parts of my scalp. It doesn't smell that great, the smell of chemicals is disappointing. The only thing I like about this product is that it's really quick and easy to use. Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this product.	negatif
2548	24656313	NOT for sensitive noses I really wanted to like this, but the smell was too much for me. Some reviewers said there was no smell, but my sensitive nose says otherwise! It doesn't smell like self-tanner, but the fragrance it left on my skill smelled like the cheap perfume your grandma would buy you for Christmas. And it was difficult to get off. Good thing it was only the inside of one arm for a patch test. Sent it back.	negatif
2549	1490025	I had such high hopes for this and after wanting to try Ojon for some time decided to give this detangler a go. I have blond processed hair and the Lady in Boots suggested this one would be best for me.Well firstly it doesn't smell that nice and secondly it didn't detangle my hair at all. The worst part is, when my hair dries it feels sort of rough and stiff'ish. It is very odd and I am very very disapointed after having spent so much on this useless product!	negatif
2550	5245472	got this in my sephora play box. it is fairly moisturizing and looks great on the skin; gives a nice subtle glow. but oh my god, it smells horrible! smells like the orange flavored fluoride i used to get at the dentist but x1000. the smell is SO strong and it lasts. i could still smell it after three hours. not at all worth the price. please spend your money on something that doesn't smell like fruit loops.	negatif
2551	5083760	minimal smell. Pros: no noxious smell - it's nice to find a product that doesn't smell a) strongly of sunless of tanner or b) of other smells that are to cover up the sunless tanner. Cons: many.For starters, it became sticky/gummy as I spread it, which lasted for hours after the application. The stickiness ended up turning into streakiness.When you throw in price, definitely NOT worth it, IMHO	negatif
2552	5413657	This is easily the most revolting fragrance I've smelled in years. It is sweet gardenia to the point of putrefaction, with an overlay of metal shavings, semen, and dental anesthetic. But you know? it doesn't smell like anything else out there. It's a gutsy blast to the past, when fragrances had the power to clear a room and didn't shy away from animalic notes. It happens to be godawful but 1 lippie added for originality. Now to go throw up.	negatif
2553	5674223	I have bought this before and this just doesn't smell the same and seems very watery. The smell fades very quickly and is gone within the hour. I went out and sampled this in a department store to check if it has reformulated but the one instore lasted and had a lovely smell. I don't know if the one I have received is off (stored in heat) or whether it's a fake - all I know is that it isn't right.	negatif
2554	6149343	I purchased a bottle and I thought it had gone off, returned it back to the store and got a replacement but doesn't smell like the Red door I have been purchasing for last 25 years. Its a completely different perfume and looses its scent within minutes.What the heck have you done to the classic perfume, bring back the original. The internet is full of unhappy customers who have been buying this for decades doesn't that mean anything to you.	negatif
2555	5422392	My job gifted me items from the Dr. Hauschuka range. I got two of these cleansers. Usually I use the oil cleansing method to thoroughly remove my makeup. It's more of a clay consistency than a cream. It has rough granules in it. This did a decent job at removing makeup. It doesn't smell good. It contains alcohol and fragrance. The packaging got holes where it leaked. Overall a huge pass.	negatif
2556	13642433	I really wanted to love these eye makeup remover pads, but they irritate my sensitive eyes, leaving the whole eye area red and extremely dry. They do take off all the eye makeup, and are easily portable, but thats about the best I can say about them, unfortunately. The cucumber scent is also incredibly off-putting, and doesn't smell like real cucumbers to me. Disappointed, won't buy them again.	negatif
2557	8807008	"This is a heavy sun block...the kind that leaves your face feeling like you put a warming face mask on. Every time I wear it to the beach, it leaves a ""white cast"". It doesn't smell nice.I used it up once then gave it another shot since everybody raves about it. Still didn't like it.Giving it one star because its the only sun screen with so many spf options."	negatif
2558	4856280	I received the perfume as a sample and really liked it. It was light and fresh and the scent seemed to last pretty well. A couple weeks later, after the sample was gone, I bought a full size. The perfume just doesn't smell the same. It has an odd sour note to it when I spray it and the scent is completely gone after a few minutes. I'm really disappointed with it.	negatif
2559	1700372	No matter what they claim, Red Door has changed. It was my signature perfume. So many comments whenever I wore it. Now it doesn't smell the same and doesn't last more than a few minutes. Sadly I bought three bottles and I might as well pour them down the sink. Until I read these reviews I thought that maybe I had bought copy perfumes even though I had purchased from a reputable source. I will have to find another signature perfume.	negatif
2560	5060718	I really wanted to like this based on how much I like the hair oil but there was too much wrong and not enough right. First, the smell is QUITE strong. It doesn't smell like the hair oil either- this is very strong flowery smell that doesn't go away. I would have dealt with that if it didn't leave my hair really oily. All in all, it wasn't worth keeping.	negatif
2561	5899747	Very unhappy with my purchase of Jimmy Choo, it doesn't smell the same as the others I have brought from Boots and the perfume shop. Are you 100% sure my bottle was genuine as I believe it may be a fack bottle. I have emailed you before regarding my purchase with no response. I would be very grateful if you could contact me as to what Amazon are going to do.Regards D Grimmett	negatif
2562	492365	Bad Smell I tried this after I tried the Age Perfect Golden Balm, and was disappointed to find that it has the same heavy perfume smell. So over-powering that I returned this one too. I noticed other consumers said this as well. It's a shame, because this Age Perfect line could have been perfect if they made it fragrance-free!	negatif
2563	23344640	good balm, bad smell! I only received a sample of this product, and while the balm itself was nice & had a nice pretty color on my lips, the smell was sooo horrible & overpowering. If you don't like lip balms that have a taste & smell, this one is definitely not for you. It was watermelon or something and I did not like it at all.	negatif

2577	15226694	Color is very yellow for starters. The smell is actually really strange and not at all like the sweet peach stuff that came out earlier in the year. I don't like the smell at all. Then, the foundation looks very cakey and settled in to any fine lines, wrinkles and even pores. It looked so bad that I took it off immediately and it took 2 whole makeup wipes to get it off! Very disappointed.	negatif
2578	19092770	This product just isn't for me, for my kind of hair, it only weighs it down. I think the fragrance is too much, that it gives me a headache, I don't like the smell of Garnier at all. Even though this product seems large, I still think it is too much for what it's worth. For a product and packaging that can be made so cheap doesn't need to be marketed for $4 or more dollars (I'm in the US so this is based on USD). 	negatif
2579	7880847	To be completely honest i am not a fan of this stuff.. but I also haven't used it in awhile since the last time I did i hated it.. So maybe the formula has changed? I don't find this stuff to absorb the oils from the scalp and if I use to much my scalp is itchy and the smell lasts all day and I really don't like the smell of it :/	negatif
2580	10623667	The price isn't bad, it's easy to find, and I really liked Aussie(even I don't like the smell of those) products before try this one, after some days using it, my hair started getting with a dirty appearance in the hair root and it seemed hard, so I stopped to use it and my hair looks normal again, so I won't recommend this product.	negatif
2581	18760291	I'm not a fan of these unfortunately. They don't make my hair look less greasy let alone clean and no matter how far away i hold the can when i spray I'm left with white bits all over my hair. Not a good look. I don't like the smell of any of them either. Sickly sweet. Hate how my hair feels with this in, worse than the normal dirty needing a wash feeling. Won't be buying again.	negatif
2582	11555263	I did not like the packaging of this product, I am so use to liquid lip stains. I usually buy mine through korean brands, wanted to try an american lip stain. I bought mine at target. The product its self is a pen like product. The application is easy to use but I don't like the smell or the taste of these, they are really bitter and the smell is nasty. I don't recommend this at all, i would be a bad friend if i did. Nope tossed it in the trash.	negatif
2583	24460583	I wanted to love this foundation so much, but the truth is it’s drying on me. It’s a full coverage foundation that covers pretty well. It feels lightweight on skin. It looks very nice for few minutes, but then it all dries my face and gives me visible dry patches. Also, I don’t like the smell. I don’t recommend it for people with dry skin.	negatif
2584	9833997	I tried to love this product, but I hated it. I have combination skin and this made me look like I used baby oil as primer instead. Makes my foundation smear all over the place and I get splotches on my face because my foundation won't stay put! I don't like the smell either. I thought maybe it was the foundation that I was using, so I tried using another one, but it was just as bad. Would definitely not purchase again.	negatif
2585	15637153	Purchased this because I saw it was a new product.. I don't like the smell. Although I do like other hair sprays from this brand, I felt this one didn't do much to my hair besides make it look dry. I wasn't able to manipulate my hair to give it a nice texture. It's like a liquid hair spray, but not much hold. Wouldn't purchase it again.	negatif
2586	16629131	I hate this product. It is one of my worst purchases, and really isn't worth the money. It has zero coverage. This goes on to the skin horribly, and leaves it feeling super greasy. I makes the skin look really oily, even when you set it. And personally I don't like the smell of the product either. I would suggest that you avoid this product and buy something else	negatif
2587	6070768	I don't like the smell. It's very strong. And it left my skin feeling sticky and gross all day. I put it in and was wondering why my skin felt so sticky and icky as this has never happened with a setting spray. I realized the second time that it was this causing this. I even tried it as a fix for eyeshadow by spraying on a makeup brush before getting eyeshadow on it. Since it's so sticky I figured it would be good for this but then the eyeshadow was kinda clumpy.	negatif
2588	18048312	The texture is okay. Lightweight, but still kinda greasy. This did not provide protection for my face. I still got burned when I used this at the beach, even with a large amount and reapplication. I don't like the smell, or that it stays really shiny on my face. It doesn't do well under makeup in my experience either. The claims and the ingredients are nice, however, the product did not perform well for me.	negatif
2589	18048870	I got a few small bottles of this various ways from Sephora. The texture is okay. Lightweight, but still kinda greasy. This did not provide protection for my face.

2590	5137216	I received this in my Sephora Play! Box. I don't like the smell, at all. So that's a huge negative. I don't really get why I'm spraying it in my hair, or why I have to use the whole bottle (I had to stop half way through, my hair felt so greasy and saturated). My hair doesn't feel full of life, or any different really at all. As a matter of fact, it feels crunchy. And it smells bad. I would not recommend this product.	negatif
2591	5415426	Cloying, stinky, I really tried to like this but every time I apply it I end up scrubbing it off. I don't know how to describe scents properly so I won't try.. although I don't like the smell of fresh daisies so? I usually adore flowery perfumes in all price ranges and I truly despise Daisy on me. Maybe it's a weird chemistry thing, not sure, but the popularity of Daisy is a mystery to me.	negatif
2592	10550312	This spray was sent to me from Influenster & all opinions are my own. I really wanted to like this one, however I couldn't get past the fake rose smell. I have another rose perfume that I LOVE because it smells like really roses. I'm very picky about my floral scents and this one didn't make the cut for me. It lasted a pretty long time but I really don't like the smell at all.	negatif
2593	8278704	I don't like the smell of this product, I don't like the packaging of the product. There isn't much lipstick in the tube. I know a lot of people like this line, but there is definitely better on the market. If you are going to invest in yourself, invest in a high end brand. It will last longer, apply better, and smell and taste like it isn't even makeup	negatif

2607	9957149	Urban Decay is one of my favorite brands so I was very disappointed by this product. I got it for a discount at Nordstrom Rack and I'm glad I didn't spend full price. The tint is incredibly orangey and even after that it oxidizes and flakes so your makeup looks cheap and awful. The scent is also overpowering and very unpleasant. I do occasionally use this to touch up my foundation but I hardly ever reach for it and much prefer my Maybelline BB cream.	negatif
2608	18448675	Disappointed to say the least. I wanted to love this and it be my holy grail :( well... PROS:full coverage CONS:has an awful, overpowering scent to it, cakey, sits in fine lines/dry patches. I was planning to wear it all day, until not even 10 mins after application it sat in my fine lines even after I set it. I didn’t want to leave the house with it on lol lord knows what it would’ve looked like hours into the day.	negatif
2609	11378185	I was so surprised that I did not like this smell. The smell was very odd to me for it to be a Gucci smell. The Guilty for men smells amazing and I was shocked that the women's did not smell the same!	negatif

2611	921687	Convenient Container Bad Tasting,Clumpy Application,Sticky Um I really don't understand where all the positive comments are coming from. This thing straight up sucks in my opinion. I understand everyone likes different things, but I don't see how this product could be liked. First of all it's super rough. Obviously, I know it's an exfoliator for the lips so it shouldn't be baby soft, but I felt like I was rubbing sand paper on my lips. Second of all, it doesn't smell good nor taste good. I don't go around eating my products, but you're bound to get someone in your mouth. Third of all, it's not easy to clean off your lips. It leaves a sort of wax film and you can't just wash it off or wipe it off with a Kleenex. I really wanted to love this and was excited to try it after reading all the good reviews. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it for me. :(	negatif
2612	1191098	I did not like this product. First impression- the package was wordy and repetitive. It didn't exude confidence in their claims.It doesn't smell very good. Pretty plain, not very strong and the morning after washing I didn't have any fragrance which was disappointing.When I applied it, I had dyed my hair a few days prior and it seemed to wash out some of the dye. I have very short hair and had to use quite a bit to cover my hair. It didn't feel any different than a regular conditioner.The following morning, not only Did my hair lack fragrance, it was incredibly greasy which is not something that I usually struggle with.I would not recommend this product. It looks cheap, like something that would be sent to a dollar store to clear out inventory. Doesn't do anything special and makes the hair greasy.Very disappointing product.

2614	4944088	This was, I think, disappointing. I decided to breakaway from drugstore shampoos (as they are full of not so great ingredients) and gave this shampoo and the matching conditioner a whirl. I like the conditioner as it doesn't weigh down my hair. But this shampoo, jeepers, I can't really recall ever using a shampoo that almost felt like it did not leave my hair feeling clean. I don't know if it's the coconut ingredients that weigh it down, or if it's because my with my thick hair, I feel like I have to use more shampoo in order to ensure all will be covered, but something is amiss. I'm going to finish the bottle, but I'm going to reinvest my 25 dollars in a product that does what I want, even if it doesn't smell like paradise. Geesh.	negatif
2615	5939324	BUT I don't. I've been experimenting with this product for months now trying to make it work, and so I've come to this conclusion. I'm fair skinned, and while it does look natural in color, the streaks and patchy-ness do not look natural. No matter how well I exfoliate, this product ends up streaking and patching up in the weirdest places on my body, and I use the mitt. Not only that, but this isn't buildable. Once you use it, you have to wait for it to wash off of your body completely (which could take more than a couple of showers) before you can re-apply it or else it will build up on whatever is left of the old layer of self-tanner, and you will end up looking unnaturally darker in some places than in others. So you basically have to fade back to pale before you can tan, so it's not very consistent to say the least. Also, they claim it doesn't smell like self-tanner, but it totally does.	negatif
2616	22939048	Like a comment made this week I agree with the lady. This is not the original perfume. It appeared to be in the original packaging but its not right. I have been wearing Obsession since it was launched. The perfume is generally quite strong and spicy and it lasts all day. I used to smell it on my blouse afterwards for quite a while. You only needed a couple of squirts and people used to say how lovely it smelled. The so called Obsession in this bottle is so weak its practically water. Its so weak you can't even say is Eau De Toilette, its just coloured water with a bit of smell that evaporates within 10 minutes. My husband said he could barely smell anything. When I spray it on my wrists myself to check, it doesn't smell. I am going to take it to a retailer and compare it with their stock because there is something not right here. I will be looking for a refund.	negatif
2617	22958902	The healing and skin freshening effects of cucumber have long been known, so what better to use in an eye mask? My wife tried these for the purpose of this review.Unlike other eye masks, which fit over the whole eye, these are separate small strips that fit under the eyes. They are left on for 10 minutes but the trick is getting them in the right place under the eyes in the first place. Ideally you need to lay down but then you can't see in the mirror to stick them on. Once on, they felt cooling at first but soon changed to a sore feeling. My wife took these off after the allotted time and her face was a little red under the eyes and nowhere near looking refreshed.Second step is the cream, which goes on like a moisturiser but doesn't smell all that great. It felt and looked a little better than the eye masks, thankfully, but didn't really do anything more than any other moisturiser would do.After using this rather expensive single use kit, we were left underwhelmed. It's really not worth the price and didn't provide good results.	negatif
2618	18542075	Going to go against most other reviews here and state that I don't like it.Like a boxed easter egg - you open it up and find it's mostly air and wasted packaging. It's just two fairly small tubes of cream.One is after-shave. The other is a beard-gel. Where's the logic there? Unless you shape your beard (e.g. goatee or large sideburns) you're not going to need both...Anyway, are the products any good? The after-shave gel is a semi-clear gunk with consistency that reminds me of something else. Maybe don't go there... and doesn't smell particularly nice either.The beard gel - looked promising at first. I've an old beard, and is prone to hairs spiking up. It kept most of them under control. But as it dried, the smell reminded me of... dirty bedsheets maybe? Is that where they got the name from? Bed Head indeed, maybe the name's more accurate than they wanted it to be.This one's going in the bin, sorry, it's a no from me.	negatif
2619	250155	Pros Improves Skin Texture Leaves Clean Feel Cons Bad Smell Irritates Skin Messy Best Uses Comments about The Body Shop Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Glow Mask Sachet : When I first used the product the smell only bothered me a little, but then having it sit in my face for ten minutes sure got irritating. My skin then later broke out in a red rash that last for about a day and a half. The overall mask was relatively messy and had an awful powerful smell. The only thing that it did help with was making my skin feel a tad softer after my rash went away. Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend	negatif
2620	12746838	I purchased this product after a friend of mine recommended it to me. My first reaction when using this product was that the smell of the product is so overwhelming. It is not a bad smell but a very strong smell. I have dry to normal type skin. This product felt very rough and scratchy to my skin. It left my face feeling very dry and red. I definitely would not recommend this product to someone who has dry skin.	negatif
2621	5595504	I have combination/oily skin but have no problem with any acne, this product however made me break out after only a few days using it, I don't even like the smell, smells like straight up alcohol. I thought it'd be a refresher type that I can use throughout the day but it really did nothing except break me out.	negatif
2622	13774709	I have a bottle of this and refuse to use it. The yeasty smell is too much for me, it isn't apparant immediately after application, but my face smells like a dog's infected ear for the rest of the day and that is enough to put me off of this stuff forever. I have other products with fermented ingredients that don't smell like this, so I will stick with those.	negatif
2623	11034277	I don't really like this smell and it was WAY pricey. It's a unique bottle which looks nice on the dresser where I keep my perfume but I don't reach for this and I wouldn't recommend. I got it as a gift from a friend but don't use it much.	negatif
2624	19670380	I don’t like it The smell of this product is awful, I can’t apply it on my face because the smell is disgusting. I also tried to put it on my legs which are the most dry area of my body in winter, but nothing changes. This product can be absorbed very soon but it doesn’t change my skin condition.	negatif
2625	19812336	Just not a fan of Carmex. I don’t like the medicated smell of it. I also feel like my lips don’t get as hydrated as they do with alternatives in the same price range. I haven’t tried this product in quite some time, and I probably won’t in the future.	negatif
2626	12680065	For some reason Neutrogena make up remover wipes irritate the crap out of my skin and make me all red and bumpy.

I tried this product a couple times hoping that maybe I just purchased a bad one and because my friends use these but I sadly I can't use them.	negatif
2627	5065106	easy to use, didn't work, odd smell. I got a sample size of this in my Sephora Play box. I don't like it. The smell wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I don't feel like my hair is any softer and there are a lot more flyaway. I won't be buying the full size.	negatif

2629	4819030	strong chemical smell, drying. Like a lot of people I was super excited about this product. I normally wear just a tinted moisturizer but since I love everything Tarte I decided to give it a try. This product was a complete disappointment. It had a strong chemical smell and caked up on me.	negatif
2630	5167846	drying, chemical smell. This product has a terrible chemical smell that burns my eyes and nose for that matter. It's not good on dry skin either! So for under eye's this is a NO GO! settles in lines and IS NOT hydrating at all!	negatif
2631	11270859	I got a sample of this product in my sephora play box. This perfume does not smell good. It's really overwhelming and it's completely floral. Headache inducing floral. I don't want to smell this much like flowers, I like vanilla scents more. Wouldn't buy.	negatif
2632	5135740	smells like urine. The shades in this palette vary. They are pretty. They go with multiple skin tones beautifully. The quality of the shadow is rich and worth your money. Easy to apply. The pigments last. You should never buy a product just for the packaging it comes in, BUT this one IS super adorbs. Right now though I have to give the final product 1 star out of 5 due to the scent. I do love peaches mind be, but this is way too strong, artificial, and very much overwhelming of a scent. I am going to warn those who own cats that the scent comes across as feline urine when you open the box! I can't bring myself to wear it except for when I got it and put it on my hand. (I am a super taster, so my palette IS more sensitive than to most other people). The idea of having the scent there could have been applied to the container ONLY so that it could have been easily removed. Our skin doesn't need the scent added to the make up. I really really wanted to love this. I tried. I just can't with the scent. It's does not smell like ripe peaches at all. If you can by-pass the scent then I do recommend it to you for the colors alone. I got the palette when it was first released at a Sephora store. I apologize but I just wanted to be fully open and honest.	negatif
2633	1628322	Burns/chemical smell,Smudges or Runs,Wet I had such a bad experience with this mascara, that I felt compelled to warn others about it. I don't have sensitive eyes, but minutes after applying this mascara, I had to remove it. My eyes were burning and watering before the mascara was completely dry. It went on VERY wet, and did not appear to lengthen my lashes at all. As it was drying on my first eye, I attempted to apply it to my other eye, and the burning and watering was so overwhelming that I had to blindly grab for my remover and take it off. I have NEVER had this happen before with any other cosmetic. Not worth it. I also never return makeup products (I figure it's the cost of experimenting with new products), but I will be returning this one!	negatif
2634	5879954	I bought this after seeing it in store and loving the initial citrus smell in the tube however I was a little downhearted to see it was £25 for 75ml after buying other origins masks that were the same price but for 100ml but I had heard good things about the mask and tried it out, as soon as I put a small amount onto my face there was an overwhelming chemical smell and it was making my eyes water but I figured I don't know what ginseng smells like surely it's that but after looking into the ingredients I noticed the very high alcohol content and realised that's what I was smelling. When the mask had dried and was ready to peel off I have never had such a hassle with a peel mask peeled off in the tiniest chunks and was ripping bits of skin off with it. My face was left dry, tired and my skin flakey. Do not recommend for anyone with dry or sensitive skin it's simply too strong.	negatif
2635	17443070	So, me and this moisturizer were not a great pair. It broke me out, so I only used it for a couple months before finally giving up, but even putting that aside I have some problems. It was soothing, so that's a true claim, but it felt somewhat tacky even after being on for an hour or so. It never feels dry or softens up on the skin. My skin felt somewhat sticky for hours after applying, and it was SO strongly fragranced I could barely handle it. Then figuring out it was breaking me out just put the nail in the coffin. It might work for someone else, but it certainly was not good for my sensitive and dry skin.	negatif
2636	6046563	I normally use Aussie Cleanse and Mend. For FOREVER it was the only thing that worked on my hair. As a child I always had nasty greasy hair. I would wash it and as soon as my hair dried you could see that it was NOT clean. I started using the cleanse and mend and fell in love. About a month ago I decided I wanted more volume even through I have really thick, full hair. So I decided to try the Volume shampoo and conditioner. I read reviews online and lots were positive, some said it was drying so I decided to take the risk and see for myself.The first thing I noticed was the smell of the shampoo, it's a little off. I'm not particularly fond of it and I don't even know how to describe it. Then there was the color, it was a transparent orange-ish color that was fairly unpleasant looking. Texture was a bit runny but it lathered well. The bottle is designed like all their other bottles and pretty to look at, although the cap on mine tended to get stuck shut. At first I enjoyed the shampoo, the smell didn't smell the same after it was in your hair, it smelled much better. It seemed to be adding some volume to my hair. After a few weeks though I noticed that I was shedding a lot of hair again (I had had problems with this in the past after damaged hair from a show, after many months of using cleanse and mend after the show was over I stopped losing so much hair.). My hair felt more dry and brittle. I stopped brushing altogether because it was pulling so much hair out. I was using tons of the conditioner every time (it has a good smell and nice thick consistency but didn't seem to help to much.). I have less than half of the conditioner left and more than half of the shampoo. After a month or a little more my hair is very frizzy, damaged and dry. I am going back to Cleanse and Mend and I would not recommend using the volume shampoo or conditioner.	negatif

2640	1259144	Like it's shampoo counterpart, I did not like the conditioner as well. The smell of the conditioner is spicy and sweet. However the scent lingers and it can be very overwhelming.

I feel as though this is not a good conditioner at all, At least for my hair. I would not buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif

2668	5903145	Have worn this perfume for a while now, but had run out. Unfortunately, the bottle received did not smell like the original, was much darker in colour and smelt more musty. Would not recommend, better to buy elsewhere.	negatif
2669	3171088	I bought this in good faith but I'm a 100% sure it is fake the person I gave it to already has one and it does not smell like it should also what £68.00 bottle of perfume comes with a plastic lid ? I would not recommend buying from this seller .	negatif
2670	9254445	Unpopular opinion but I wasn't wowed when I got this soap as a sample. I found it very hard to wash with and it seemed to not smell like much. Maybe it was since it was a sample size but truly the first LUSH product I wouldn't buy.	negatif
2671	16186375	I had high hopes for this sleeping pack but was very disappointed. It does not smell like pumpkin (or anything, really) and I felt like my face was actually DRYER in the morning! Definitely will not repurchase.	negatif
2672	5668130	not the same as you buy in hairdressers mode was very thin , did not smell like holidays, i don't think this is the original product, very runny, had to throw away, thought it was a bargain at 6 pound but no good	negatif
2673	5066997	I can't get past the scent, and it definitely does not smell like almonds. It reminds me of how my dolls smelled as a child, a weird sweet plastic-y smell. I'm glad I only purchased the small bottle. I also didn't notice any moisturizing benefits.	negatif
2674	5392863	I didn't like this product and was ready to throw it away after 2 days of using. I don't like the scent, the texture of it is too harsh in my opinion and even though I don't have either dry or sensitive skin, it dried out my skin and it became flaky. I don't have acne either, but blemishes do pop up every now and then (especially on my forehead, chin and jawline). This wasn't much help spot-treatment-wise. I reckon it might work better for people who have light to moderate acne.	negatif
2675	1132083	This stuff was just GROSS. It is a gel; but it's super thick and hard to get out of the container. I would more call is slime. LOL Plus it doesn't smell good at all, and it's super hard to rinse off. Ugh. To add insult to injury, it's supposed to be super hydrating and natural, right? Well, it DRIED out my skin!! I use all types of cleansers and usually the hydrating ones are all fine on me, it's just the salicylic acid ones that dry out my skin. Really just an utter failure, I can't recommend it at all!	negatif

2677	1633793	Easy To Apply,Smooth Doesn't Stay On,Heavy,Ineffective I've been on the hunt for a new glowy or hydrating primer. Thought I'd give this a shot. Honestly--it feels, looks, and smells EXACTLY like the Visable Lift Primer (which I also don't care for). It's like they just repacked it and slapped a new name on it for the Pro line. Very unimpressed. Also--I do notice a smell--almost like crayons or play doh. Doesn't smell nice--least not to me. Not worth the money at all.	negatif
2678	1140454	I seen so many good reviews and Youtubers using it that I thought it would be great. Wrong! Not only did it make my hair oily faster, it doesn’t smell very good (my husband hates it and ask me to wash my hair again), I found it weighed my hair down and made it feel heavy and lifeless. I’ve used it for a month and have not seen any improvement in my hair and will not finish the rest of the bottle. I wished I’d figured it out sooner so I could have returned it. Not worth the almost $40 CAD price tag.	negatif
2679	5211194	I have been using this product for years and would consider it one of my holy grails. It keeps everything in place and I love it. Recently I re-purchased it because I'm out and noticed the package had changed. Not thinking anything else would change I added it to my cart. Trying it I realized there was an odd scent. I keep trying it out and the smell is really ruining this holy grail product for me. I'm extremely upset at this horrible smell and will be returning and looking for a new setting spray that doesn't smell so artificial and horrible. I'm extremely disappointed in this product change.	negatif
2680	5443608	I should have realised that a 90ml bottle of Shalimar Eau de Parfum which normally retails at over £100 and which here costs just over £50 is likely to be a fake or very old stock. I'm undecided which it is but as a lifelong lover and user of Shalimar, I can say this is rubbish. It doesn't smell anything like it and lasts a nano-second which - considering it's a crap smell - isn't such a bad thing. Steer well clear of this and if you do want the true Shalimar smell, spend more and get the real thing!!	negatif
2681	16798587	I loved the 2012 Miss Dior Eau de Parfum. I’ve gone through many bottles. It’s my go to fragrance. I wish I had gotten a sample and tried it a few days before I purchased. I wanted to like it(kept trying to convince myself that I liked it) but it’s so baby powder smelling. Doesn’t smell young and fresh. Smells old. I’m in my forties and want to smell good, not old! Hopefully I will be able to return since I’ve only had it a couple of weeks.	negatif
2682	13537177	I received a sample of the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift® Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer to reveiew.I forced myself to use it for a week, just to see if I'd change my mind.I kind of liked the smell, at least it doesn't smell musty nd like wet dirt as many other facial creams do. So opening it up I was pretty excited.Putting it on though, no matter how thin I try to do that, it feels like caky foundation. Heavy and thick, and that feeling stayed for over an hour.I already don't wear foundation, I want my facial cream to be light and fast absorbent.	negatif
2683	1435419	Good points...it doesn't smell. That's pretty much it!! My natural hair colour is light brown...thanks to this hair dye it is now dark brown. The colour on the box is just to show you what light brown hair should look like. The colour you end up with is a dull dark brown and bears no resemblance what so ever to the box. The blend of tones were non existant...unless the hues of muddy puddle count as 'tones'. Its just awful on all levels. Hands down the worst hair dye I have ever used. I'm now going to have to get my hair stripped and redyed to try and rectify the mess. My product recommendations	negatif
2684	19701308	"Not moisturizing, doesn't smell like rose at all I don't understand the hype behind this ""cult-favorite"" product. Hydrating-wise: it's not as hydrating as advertised. I have oily-combination skin that is flaky, dessert dry in the Canadian winter. However, this product doesn't help one bit. It's more like an expensive gel that cools your face but doesn't provide any moisturizing effect. Scent-wise: I'm a big fan of roses, but this product smell nothing like roses. It's very artificial; think of roses that have been brewed in veggie broth, it smells like that. Overall, overpriced, doesn't deliver on either the moisturizing impact or the rosy smell."	negatif
2685	2956468	I've been a fan of this product for approx. ten years but was disappointed to find when I received my last order that it seems to have been watered down. Previously, two or three sprays of this perfume were all that was necessary to provide a long-lasting fragrance. The change is significant. To achieve on a surface level the same result I need to spray approx. eight times. However, it really is a surface level as the fragrance does not persist as it used to. I loved it for it's smell, but it doesn't smell the same anymore therefore I won't purchase it again.	negatif
2686	25335367	Smelled so awful I'm writing my first review I can not get past the smell! I've read through the other reviews and it seems I might be alone in this so maybe I got a bad bottle? It literally smells like men's B.O.! I do not usually have any sensitivity to odors but this doesn't smell like any product I've ever used before for hair or skin care. It's truly awful. As far as performance, I did nothing to texturize my hair so any waves it encouraged did not stay. I have thick hair that is single-processed and has natural wave.	negatif
2687	4738870	I had such high hopes for this (pun intended...). I used it once and had to wash it off and return it right away. The smell is such a unique and lingering odor, it went away completely only after two hard scrubs of face wash and lathering on a different, better smelling moisturizer. The consistency of the cream was very gel like once going on my face. It would not rub into my skin very well at all. The color of the product also made me concerned it had gone bad, which should have stopped me from even trying it, but I was optimistic. Renewed Hope in a Jar Dry has been a success so far, doesn't smell and doesn't turn into a weird gel when applying.	negatif
2688	5257665	got this as a free sample and i was excited, but i don't like it at all. i'm not a fan of the smell. doesn't smell like coconut to me and it lasts until you take it off. the spray nozzle is bad. it doesn't spray evenly and squirts you in the face almost. it leaves droplets on your face that don't seem to dry down. tried using it as a primer but really didn't notice anything different. save your money, don't bother. better off just using water to set your makeup.	negatif

They now give me headaches and I just find them too strong and unpleasant. I had high hopes for this but it smells exactly like a perfume. And a strong one at that! A very strong smelling perfume that smells like every other perfume. I am not sure why some are saying it doesn't smell like anything (it does!!!!! It really does!!) Or why it doesn't last long (it stayed on so if! I tried scrubbing it off of me!) In all, nope.	negatif
2692	5078362	easy to use, lack luster, thick, expensive. This mask was easy to use, sure, but for the expensive price tag, I expected so much more. I have color processed, curly hair that I frequently straighten. Needless to say, my hair is dependent on a good conditioner. When I received this in my Play box I was excited to give it a try but I was so disappointed to find that it does nothing to make my hair feel soft or smooth or rejuvenated as the product claims.

2694	5650497	Because the write up was so good I bought 2 bottles, one for myself and one for my daughter's birthday. However, I opened one bottle to use myself but was really disappointed. The smell is nothing like the discription, in fact it doesn't smell like perfume. It's a pity It's not as nice as the pretty bottle suggests. I now have an unwrapped box of perfume that I now can't give to anyone as it's not nice at all. I will never buy fragrance on a whim again but will make sure I use a tester first. I've rated it with one star because I am unable to mark it zero.	negatif
2695	23235563	My mother's a great fan of the Decleor Aromessence Neroli Hydrating Oil Serum, and has been using it for a while, so she knows about it and knows how it should feel. I bought her two bottles online because it would be a lot less expensive than buying from her usual store. Quick delivery time, so far so good!However, with the first bottle, she had a quite marked skin reaction a few minutes after using it. My mother has somewhat sensitive skin, so we weren't totally surprised by this, but the product also looked and smelled strange. It's almost transparent rather than the pale yellow colour shown in the pictures and it doesn't smell anything like what it should do.She didn't dare use the product again for a while, but just the other day opened the second bottle and it smells and looks normal and worked a treat. We've kept the first bottle and the liquid inside is now completely transparent and smells like industrial chemicals rather than something you'd want to have on your skin. Clearly, something is very badly wrong.So one bottle was great, the other one had something very different in it. Here's the rub though: I bought two bottles because of an discount offer that was going on at the time where if you bought two bottles, it was cheaper. It seems the way to achieve this is to provide one genuine bottle and one with something fake and nasty inside it.Not impressed!	negatif

2716	1327120	I got this, and the matching body wash but unfortunately ended up having to return them both. If you’re someone who doesn’t want a strong scented payoff from your lotion... then this is for you. The smell is so light that it’s almost nonexistent. However if you’re like me, and LOVE using a lotion that leaves a nice but subtle smell after using it, then this isn’t for you. Also, the smell seemed to have a burnt almost plastic-y smell. It definitely didn’t smell like fresh cream to me. I really couldn’t get over the weird plastic-y burnt smell so had to return. For anyone interested in a similar product, there is a Fresh Cream & Mint that just smells delicious, of vanilla toasty minty goodness. I’m not sure if it’s sold on Sephora though.	negatif
2717	5395217	This is a perfect example of how products from the same range can smell markedly different. I had the shower gel from this range, which smelt exactly as I expected - fresh, ripe peaches with just a hint of sweetness. But this is a different story altogether.The first time I opened this I noticed a very pungent smell, which took me a few moments to recognise. Then I realised what it was - it smelt like broad beans (fava beans)! It was a really strong, earthy, plant-like scent, that only got worse once I applied it and started working it into my skin. One thing it definitely didn't smell of was peaches.The other issue I had was the 'scrub' part of this. This is one of TBS's cream-based scrubs which never seem to be as effective as their sugar-based ones, which in my opinion do a far superior job of making my skin feel in better condition afterwards.Definitely not what I was expecting, not worth the Â£13.00 price tag and I wouldn't be tempted to purchase it again in the future.	negatif

2719	6150280	I agree with many of the reviewers. This has been my ONLY fragrance for over 20 years. I used to get so many compliments on the scent. And the scent lasted all day. I recently got a new bottle and was unsure that it was an original since the bottle had changed. And then the first time I used it, I gasped. It didn't smell the same. It had an off odor and didn't seem as strong. I now need to use 2 spritzes and it doesn't even last a half day. How can Elizabeth Arden call this their signature fragrance? It smells cheaper and doesn't even last all day. And I no longer get compliments. Please bring back your original formula. We who loved the old product are not being fooled. I will be searching for a new fragrance that will get compliments.	negatif
2720	5206446	terrible fragrance, chemical smell. This smells like a mix of woodsy hairspray mixed with bug repellent. After a couple uses, it's safe to say that this is just terrible. There's base notes of wood and grass, but it's completely covered by a harsh chemical smell; absolutely no florals as it claims to have. After it dries down, the chemical smell becomes less harsh, but is still definitely noticeable. Completely unwearable for me.	negatif

2736	9109946	This stuff is AWFUL! I bought this a couple winters ago to keep up my glow up between spray tans. I used it once and that was enough for me. The first thing I noticed when I applied it was the awful smell. I know that self-tanning lotions always have a bit of a smell to them, but this was the worst because they tried to cover it up with an overwhelming powdery smell. Additionally, this stuff has an insane amount of shimmery sparkly stuff in it. I felt like a vampire straight out of Twilight after I put this stuff on because it reflected so much in the light. And of course, this didn't give me the nice bronze glow it promises, but a terrible shade of orange. If you are looking for a cheap self-tanner, go with the Jergens gradual tanner instead.	negatif
2737	14678041	This product does a good job plumping up skin overnight and giving it a healthy glow. It absorbs into my skin without a greasy reeling. And it leaves my skin moisturizer.

The overwhelming, headache inducing scent makes this product a complete deal breaker for me. I will not be repurchasing.	negatif
2738	24319352	I got this in a voxbox and was really excited to try, but honestly it smelled awful. I’ve only worn it once and couldn’t wait to get it off.

2739	22650117	First of all, finding my shade for this was a disaster. It's a full coverage foundation that has a really strong cucumber scent, so if you don't like the smell of that, or just scents in your foundation you won't like this foundation. Second of all, I used like 5 different primers, 3 kinds of powders on different occasions, even alternated between a kabuki brush and beauty blender. I even moisturized and it was still UGLY. It settled on every fine line on my face, it clung to my dry patches in weird ways, and my boyfriend who knows absolutely nothing about makeup said it looked CRUSTY. So I would pass, will try to return it. 	negatif

2741	13057791	I've been seeing this shampoo for years when I go to cut my hair and I've always wanted it, but it was expensive so I didn't. With my new job I I decided I could afford it so I finally bought it and was so excited and it just ended up a huge disappointment. It makes my hair greasy and flat and actually sticky it's so gross. I have to use a clarifying shampoo every few days just so my hair doesn't look disgusting which has completely stripped the color and has dried it out. I would just throw it out if it hadn't been expensive. I also don't like the smell it reminds me of a car wash.	negatif
2742	19856382	You know, there's just something that doesn't do it for me about bar soap. Almost my whole family swears by it, but I just can't jump on the bandwagon. First of all, I don't like the smell. To me, it smells like my grandmother. I don't want that smell on me for the entire day - it's almost nauseating. Second of all, I never feel super clean after using this soap! I feel like it leaves a little bit of film on my skin and that I need to shower again soon after getting out. I would much rather deal with a different kind of liquid soap to help me feel cleaner. 	negatif

2744	4772762	I got this cleanser in a small tube as my birthday gift from Sephora and I wasn't impressed with it. For starters I don't like the smell at all, but that's just a personal thing. I've been using it for about 5 days now and I don't plan on using it anymore. my skin is usually more on the dry side than anything but I still sometimes get a few pimples here and there. just a few days after I started using this my face broke out really bad. worse than it has in a while. This cleanser isn't anything special - I would not recommend it.	negatif
2745	19535414	I was really disappointed with this product! I don't like the smell of it and I really feel like it did nothing to help my skin! I've left my review so much later as I persevered and kept using it every morning but to be honest I'm only using it now because it's there not because I like it at all! It doesn't feel like it's Doug anything to your face when you're are using it either! Just wasn't for me I guess! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2746	1471881	I received the dry multi use oil as a sample. While I love that it has several uses, I cannot get over the super strong perfume smell that it has. It is very overwhelming. My husband did not like the smell either. Also, compared to a different dry oil that I have used, this one was more thin, yet felt heavier and greasier in my hair.

2776	1267456	I've been using this product for 10 plus years, and have been happy with the results until now. First of all I was lucky enough to find the same number, but the results are way darker and not as much highlights. When I opened the box there were no gloves so I had to make a trip to the store to find some. Couldn't tell when the cream was mixed, it was all white, and don't like the new smell. I will be looking for another product	negatif
2777	23817512	This is the absolute worst! First of all, I love all things Eucalyptus and this DID NOT smell anything even close.

2782	4845708	After seeing wonderful reviews about this concealer, I had to finally try it, everyone was hyping this up. I have pretty dark circles, it's probably my biggest insecurity and this product did not help it one bit. The first thing you notice about this is the overwhelming strong chemical smell, it's comparable to paint thinner. So I was already weary about putting it on my skin at all and when I tried it, it did nothing. I don't have particularly dry under eyes but this drys them out very bad and the coverage isn't initially that great and then an hour later it's worn off even set with a powder. It just doesn't mesh with my skin very well at all, the product just breaks apart very quickly and isn't flattering. I have tried to love this so many times and every time I am disappointed. I won't be giving it anymore chances. The one thing I do use it for and the only reason I gave it 1 star is that it's great for highlighting your brows but that's it. I had to find a use for it because I purchased it in a different city on a road trip so I wasn't able to return it as much as I wanted to. Still on the search for my holy grail concealer!	negatif
2783	5025487	dependent on the wearer. I know that on some it smells divine, which it why I tried it on at my local Sephora. This was not the case for me. Its opening was definitely interesting. I wasn't enchanted by it but I was willing to let it sit for it's fragrance to properly develop. I admittedly could not stand it after 45 minutes. For me, there was no change in scent that others had experience. It had the overwhelming scent of urinal cake when I let it rest. It's not a bad smell necessarily if I have never smelt a urinal cake, but the connection was just too much for me. I had to wash it off.	negatif

It does not smell pleasant , and it is not worthy of the Chloe name .

There is nothing pleasant about this fragrance .	negatif

Waste of Money!!!	negatif
2791	1312204	When I first looked at the bottle, I noticed it said 2-in-1 - however, it didn't specify it as a Shampoo and Conditioner.

2792	960725	I read other reviews before purchasing this product and thought this body butter would smell so good. I was extremely disappointed when this arrived today.

2793	5186736	I was so excited about a nice lip oil gloss. Peach is one of my favorite scents. This did not smell like peach.

It felt nice so if you can tolerate the smell then it's a good purchase but I would definitely recommend smelling it before buying it	negatif
2794	1923207	This perfume does not smell like the one I've been using for at least a decade. I could compare because I still have a bit of perfume left in my bottle.

2795	5688477	Instead of it being sealed as all Pureology products are, it was taped shut. The bottle also seemed part used. It wasn't completely full.

2798	8479225	Absolutely hate this product. The smell reminds me of old deep fryer fat, and although I do love French fries I would rather my face not smell like one.

2802	5887720	I bought the 100ml bottle and it was sealed with a piece of sellotape when I received it. It was in a slightly different shaped bottle than the ones you buy in the shops.

2803	5399973	I first tried this way back around 1990/1991 as a young girl (around 20 years old back then) and did not care for it. Too heavy and too overpowering and gave me a headache. Just felt to me like an 'older lady scent'. Well, now as an 'older lady,' at age 45, I decided to try this again. Still a no-go for me. Headache and dizziness inducing. And it lasts all day, it is as strong on me from the time I spray it until I take my clothes off some 10-12 hours later. It is a heavy scent, no matter how you look at it I think, and I think one spray will do ya. The upside to this is, if you like the fragrance, it will last you a long time. But I would not wear this to work or to school or around anyone with allergies, asthma or a sensitive nose. Powerful fragrance!! The strange thing for me is, in looking at the fragrance notes of this on fragrantica.com, I would think I would like this. But something in there throws off all those notes for me (or maybe just the combo of everything) just gives me a terribly horrible headache. Sadly, I never get any compliments when wearing this...it also imho has a chemical smell about it..You can check the main notes and accords here, I tried to copy and paste, but it was not working..: http://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elizabeth-Arden/Red-Door-86.html	negatif

I'm going to pass this to a friend and see if it works for them since everyone's skin is different.	negatif
2810	23028570	Made hair dull and scent was overpowering Received this as a beauty insider reward. I had never used a dry shampoo and was excited to try this product, thinking a foam would be easy to use. I don't know if it was my inexperience with dry shampoo but I found it a little difficult to apply to just my roots. I felt my hair actually looked dull after all of the product was worked into my hair. I also did not like the smell of the product. The scent reminded me of perm solution.	negatif

2812	1271012	Not Greasy Bad Smell,Ineffective I absolutely hate this toner. First of all, it's smells so strong, it's really overpowering, and it obviously contains alcohol, because it just smells like you are just putting rubbing alcohol all over your face. Also, it has done absolutely nothing for my pores, even though it's supposed to be a pore refining toner. I would never recommend this, and I think I'm going to throw away my pretty full bottle because I can't take putting it on any more. Hard pass!! Awful, awful, awful.	negatif
2813	23077938	Skin type: Combination, oily nose and dry forehead.Unfortunately, I found this foundation to be one of the worst I've tried. It's very difficult  to say anything good about it and if pressed I would say that I like the liquid format and  that the shade was pale enough (I have very pale skin and sometimes that can be a problem).I usually wear a light coverage Matte foundation, so was hoping this would cover more flaws,  but right from applying it there was nothing but problems. I did my usual skincare routine  before applying (exfoliate to prevent peely look), rose water, moisturise and prime, leaving  enough time between each of these steps to not interfere with the foundation.Despite this, it seemed to cling to every flaw, sinking into lines and making my skin look  peely and damaged and clinging onto fine blonde hairs. After a little googling, it seems I am  not the only combination skin lady to have this problem, so I definitely wouldn't recommend  it to those with combination skin.It never seemed to blend correctly and after a few hours my skin looked patchier than ever.  With the foundation applied and blended all the way, I looked like a ghost with bad skin. It  evened out my skin tone, but was so heavy that it looked way too white (not a problem if you  contour, I guess, but not great for those who like a simpler makeup). It also felt stiff and  uncomfortable, like a mask.The worst was yet to come. When I tried to remove it with my regular AND heavy duty makeup  remover, it clung and didn't want to come off. Five cotton pads later, my face was finally  (mostly) clean, but the skin was damaged and had broken out a lot. I also had a lot of  trouble removing it from my blender.It also doesn't smell great and the packaging is very cheap looking, but those are the least  of my worries when the foundation just didn't work for me, but actively damaged my skin.	negatif
2814	18516770	**delux sample**disclaimer- I generally hate all face oilsThis is the second product in the Nude brand range I have had the misfortune to try. The one good thing about this oil is that it does absorb. Ironically I found each day I used it my skin was DRYER. Yes dryer.The second good thing is it did not irritate my skin or eyes. But it was pretty useless.....So I gave it to my husband to use on his Klingon forehead and on the first day he complained bitterly about the smell of it.It is not that strongly fragranced- it just smells a bit like rosemary and thyme....In desperation I used it up on my dry feet (to no great effect) and heaved a sigh of relief I had finished it.It retails for Â£58 for 30ml. I'd pay about Â£ 5 max for it	negatif

2823	14410890	A real joke, I don't know why Garnier still selling their crap products. Yes , its cheap but I know cheap products who's worth the money. Their shampoo and conditionner makes your hair greasy and let a old chemical scent from the 90's. Don't waste your money on theses.	negatif

2846	15064579	The only good thing that came out of this product is the fact that it has a violet tint which kinda helped tone my balayage highlights. However, this product has isopropyl alcohol. In other words it is not a fatty alcohol that will benefit your hair. This mask will only provide temporary conditioning but in the long run it WILL damage your hair. I'm honestly appalled Redkin has such ingredient in this considering the price tag and what it claims to do. I had to return because it did nothing to my hair except make my ends a little crunchy which means that too much product is left on my hair after rinsing off. Also the smell is extremely strong which is good for people that like that kind of stuff but I personally don't like strong scent in my products because scent is not a good thing to have especially when it is in the top half of the ingredient list (this one has scent placed in the third row and it has eight rows of ingredients). 	negatif
2847	1305778	I tried this out on 2 of my dollheads, one with light hair and the other with dark hair, like mine. I wanted to test the ability for this product's promises to truly produce noticeable pigment on dark hair and low and behold, it failed to do so. After washing, it still looked like brown hair, only slightly darker. It showed up fine on the blonde hair, which was no surprise considering blonde hair is generally more porous and since it doesn't have red, orange, and yellow underlying pigment to fight through to show up, it's more noticeable. This simply failed to fulfill its promise to work universally for all hair colors. It had the minor smell of a relaxer (rotten eggs), so I guess that's a plus because it doesn't smell like pneumonia like it promises. I couldn't recommend this to anyone with a clean conscience.

2848	5409632	I really wanted to love this, because there are very few primers out there for dry skin, and I love Too Faced.But the scent is unbearable. I am not sensitive to scents and can put up with quite chemical-smelling products, but this makes me feel sick. It doesn't smell like coconut - it smells like a sugary chemical cocktail spiked with coconut essence. And it's so strong! Even when I layered my foundation on top, I could still smell it, and ended up taking off my makeup just to get rid of it. This primer also isn't very thick or creamy. If you have normal to dry skin rather than lizard-dry skin like me, then this may be the right consistency for you. But for me, I need something that will smooth over my flaky, rough patches and actually moisturises my face. I would steer clear of this if you have sensitive skin or don't like strong scents, and if you have truly dry skin. If you have normal/slightly dry skin, I'd recommend smelling this in store before you buy to make sure that you can cope with the scent.	negatif
2849	15719515	I was so disappointed in this product. i absolutely hated it. First off, it doesn't smell like indian lilac, it smells like a man. i have asked multiple people what does this smell like and they all have a disgusted face after and say why does your hair care products smell like a straight up dude?? It's repulsive. Next, the shampoo is terrible. It barely cleans my hair let alone does anything for my dandruff. On top of that, the packaging is awful. My shampoo will not close no matter what i do. It's annoying to have to sit there trying to store it so the product won't leak out. But i absolutely can't get past the smell everytime i use it so these products are being trashed. I was sent these products for review for free but my opinions obviously remain my own.	negatif
2850	6287012	I love Batiste (the original one) so thought this would be good too, however, I'm really disappointed with it. The product looks great, the can is a great shape and a great product design on the can, really feminine and eye-catching. The product itself doesn't smell that great to me, but that could be because I'm not a fan of cocoa smells, personal choice! It was easy enough to apply to unwashed hair using the 'halo method' that Batiste advise on the can, however, was hard to distribute through my hair and brush through, and ended up with lots of white residue all over myself, my sofa and my black carpet! After distributing the product as best as I could throughout my hair, I tried styling my hair. Looking in the mirror, it looked like I'd just rubbed some greasy serum through my hair and attempted to comb it through! What a mess!! I gave up and ended up washing my hair after that, so didn't save me the time I was supposed to save me! I think I'll stick to the original batiste dry shampoo instead of these new fangled ones!	negatif
2851	3025252	This fragrance is a very poor version of the original Gucci by Gucci pour homme. P&G have apparently insisted that the outer packaging and rename to Gucci pour homme is a rebrand and the fragrance is the same (according to the perfume departments of several major high street retailers), but I have a bottle of the by Gucci version and one of this new stuff and am quite certain that this is not true.I have been using the original fragrance for a number of years and it has a lingering scent that lasts an entire day, or evening, which is not true of the current formulation... and it doesn't smell as nice.Yes, it is cheap when purchased from Amazon, which is why I was initially convinced it was a fake. I have since been around the high street and found that this is the new original (as P&G would have you believe), so I am now mourning the loss of my favourite fragrance. Time to move on and find another, as I wouldn't want this one as a gift, never mind pay for it!	negatif
2852	5934149	Let me start with, I'm pretty pale. Think, 2nd to lightest in most foundation shades. I use Loving Tan, Ultra Dark, and get a beautiful tan. I was going out of town, Loving Tan had gone bad, I needed a quick tan. I ran to Sephora, got this Tarte tanner, HAD heard good YouTube reviews on it, and had high hopes. One claim is that it doesn't smell... yeah right... I figured it would go away after it developed and I showered it off. No. I woke up in the middle of the night and gagged because I could still smell it. Think frying coconut. Very very heavy scent. Let's also comment on the color that I got. A very dark orange. Very patchy even though I exfoliated and moisturized prior to putting it on. After I showered 3 hours later, a majority washed off. When I showered the next day it was almost gone. By the next day it had completely worn off except for a few dark patches on my arm and top of my foot. Bizarre. To summarize, SMELLS AWFUL, BAD COLOR, and NOT LONG-LASTING. The end. Returning ASAP. Already ordered Loving Tan.	negatif
2853	5177028	I really wanted this all natural deodorant to work for me, but sadly it didn't. I got the Vanilla Coconut scent, and while I did like the smell--it definitely doesn't smell like vanilla or coconut. To me it has more of a fresh laundry scent to it, which I didn't mind, but also wasn't what I was expecting. I wore this deodorant for a good week. It couldn't even get me through a whole typical day before it wore off (was not doing anything that was physically demanding or strenuous that would cause me to be sweating)--only lasted about 4, maybe 5, hours on me. I did like that the cap is a twist cap. It made me feel like the actual deodorant stayed protected and fresh. Also, I liked that the twist-up bottom was not a typical click dispenser like standard deodorants--it twists up smoothly. Overall I just couldn't love the product or get it to work for me. My search for a decent natural deodorant continues.	negatif
2854	1650856	I used the Brilliant Brunette moisturising shampoo and conditioner for years very happily. A couple of months ago they changed the formula/ingredients (without saying so on the packaging). The shampoo now leaves my hair much drier than before and now doesn't smell nice in my opinion (kind of like strong incense sticks). I would not recommend this product on new formula. For info, you can tell the new formula bottles as the words Colour protection appear in a blue strap/band across the middle of the bottle (whereas before there was no blue band). I promptly returned to Boots and am now in search of a new shampoo and moisturiser :(If you are going to buy this (new formula) product for the first time, I suggest you try the 250ml bottle first rather than the 500ml in case you don't like it.	negatif

2857	4998973	I really wanted to love this. I went into the store knowing exactly what I wanted. I did research on it. But, the more I used it the more I didn't like it. I don't even like the smell, it is a bit too much for me. I think it caused my skin to breakout just a bit. I just can't make myself reach for it after the first few times. My skin just doesn't react well to it. I think my skin is too sensitive for it. I don't know. I'm going to be returning it as soon as possible. I am so disappointed.	negatif
2858	19720349	Not for me Pricey for me, but I really wanted to try this lipstick. Sad to say I'm returning it. The color chart is off, so the color I ordered is not what I expected, but the larger issue is that this lipstick has a distinctive bad taste.	negatif
2859	14584232	Very patchy on my lips, settled into lines badly. Poor pigmentation, bad taste and smell. The packaging was cute but that's about it. Had little to no wear time. Will not ever buy again! Do not recommend at all!	negatif
2860	18457063	I heard great things about this product but was pretty disappointed when I tried it. It sits on top of my lips, doesn’t hydrate and leaves a bad taste in my mouth from the strong chemically smell. It also doesn’t give much colour to the lips. Wouldn’t recommend this.	negatif
2861	19800789	I was really looking forward to this lip stain. Unfortunately it wasn’t very noticeable and it left my lips immediately after application. It had a very bad taste if you lick your lips every once in awhile. I will not purchase again.	negatif
2862	16385537	Not the best. I really don't do water proof mascara and this one didn't help my bad taste. It doesn't do much and you need to put on too much. And then it's like glue on your lashes. I would not buy again.	negatif

2866	24653904	TASTES BAD I purchased this product because of the hype from youtubers, now it sits in my makeup drawer. This product has a bad taste compared to my other chapsticks and lip scrubs from Lush. It leaves a sticky feeling on my lips. This makes my hair stick to my lips. I would not rebuy this product.	negatif
2867	12565723	I tried this product and it left a bad taste lol first off it was super drying after you remove it and I'm not even sensitive but it took off some of the skin on my face literally I had to add a hydrating oil along with a super hydrating moisturizer b/c the moisturizer alone did not work	negatif

2870	4721126	bad taste, no interesting. I perfectly agree with the pevious review. I am also a lip balm fan, but this one is boring. Nothing special except the original packaging. The worst thing is the very intense sweety taste. Desapointed!	negatif
2871	18629221	I know that this cleanser is very popular on television Qvc Bc they keep on show casing this on all their stupid philosophy shows I I actually got to try it bc I got a free deluxe sample size of it from Sephora a long time ago & Although it didn't seem to bother my skin it did leave it kinda dry but not too dry Bc I have very oily skin! But I would never spend my money on this garbage stuff Bc just by checking out the ingredients in this stuff it nothing but irritating ðŸ˜  essential oils & black pepper extract in it ! Paula b gives it a bad review & I agree! & I don't like the smell of this stuff! To me it smelled like bug ðŸœ spray! It wasn't a pleasant scent ðŸ˜³! LOL!	negatif
2872	25839032	I’m just gonna come right out and say it... I DONT LIKE CARMEX! I don’t like the smell, the taste, or it’s ingredients... The people that create this product aren’t stupid! They know exactly what they’re doing when they put the same ingredients in Carmex that your lips produce naturally and because Carmex is giving you that moisture, your lips don’t have to produce it anymore, making you completely dependent on it for the moisture your lips need... It’s the same with Visine Original Redness Relief Eye Drops... It’s made to give your eyes moisture but after so long, your eyes will stop producing that moisture on their own because they don’t have to.. Visine is doing it for them! Which again leaves you completely dependent on it, in order to keep your eyes happy... In closing, these companies do this so they can keep you coming back for more, keep you buying their product, it’s a trick to keep their pockets lined with money and we blindly hand it over not knowing that what we are buying is creating a much bigger problem and down the rabbit hole we go!	negatif
2873	2899582	I've been using Fake Bake 60 Minutes for a while but thought this might be easier as you apply it every day. I found the product very thick and gloopy, difficult to apply, I really had to rub it in which was hard work. I have dry skin and this just seemed to stay on the surface like an oil slick (usually use Aveeno daily which is great). I left this on for half an hour while I dried my hair and it still wasn't dry so by then I was bored of waiting so I had a quick shower. Then put on dark clothes (jeans) and this still came off all over the inside of my clothes even after half an hour and the shower. Not a terrible problem because I could wash the clothes but it all seemed very messy and I don't like the smell. The tan colour didn't really suit me either as I found it quite pinky and I have yellow tone (blonde) skin.I won't use this again, found it really messy to use, I'll go back to my previous tan products. Other people seem happy with it though so I suppose you just need to find what suits you.	negatif

2878	1119551	Don't buy this product! How the heck does it have a 4.5 rating overall. I'm not sure what's actually in the bottle of perfume I bought. It does not smell like my past purchases of Happy Heart-not when you first spray it or on my clothes after it's been on awhile. I'm not sure if the product is old, watered down, or what, but I'm bummed. What a waste of my hard earned money!	negatif
2879	1123964	Hold your money, bought this product for my girlfriend and I was not happy with the results. After my girlfriend sprayed the perfume on herself the scent only lasted for 30 minutes... Even after she sprays a lot on herself , no more than an hour later she had a Musky smell from it. This product is a douche de toilet which means it's mixed with water and lighter scent.. the main problem I have is a Musky smell after an hour of her spring it on.. this product is not smell like a daisy dream like it should.	negatif
2880	1277947	I hated it. Did not smell like roses. some of my hair fell out. my hair felt like it was fire. another over promised under delivered product.

It may just been an allergic reaction but use at your own risk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
2881	5943294	This product is awful in so many ways. The scent is soapy and does not smell like roses at all. I typically enjoy scented products but this was so fake and strong it was intolerable. It's STICKY and TACKY and I'm pretty sure there's no significant amount of vitamin C. I have only reacted 1 other time the way I reacted to this product. The day after trying it I broke out in dermatitis (red itchy bumps like what others describe). Because it's PERFUME and not skin care. Beware.	negatif
2882	4822435	The name is so deceiving. It does not smell like vanilla AT ALL! It smells like those cheap deodorants from the grocery store. I also felt really sticky after awhile and OMG DID I STANK!!! I had to use my toms to cover up the stench of both my sweat and the gross cheap smell mushed together. Blegh! I was looking forward to this deo after so much rave from my bff, so when it finally went back in stock I went and got the small $8 version to try it out, but I'm not ever gonna use it again.	negatif
2883	4773556	I adore the L'eau D'Issey toilette spray and thought this would make a great complementary layer to the scent. But the lotion does not smell like the toilette spray at all. Not even close. In fact, I couldn't wash the lotion/scent off my hands fast enough but its (icky) scent still seemed to linger with me throughout the day. So maybe that says something about its staying power, but the scent was just not L'Eau D'Issey. I am returning this.	negatif
2884	17595600	I am not a huge fan of this product. Does not smell like blueberries and the scent is strong and unpleasant. Product claims to be gentle and moisturizing which I find that it is not. It burned my face and my skin felt extremely dry for days. Not sure if being pregnant has anything to do with the way my skin reacted to them but I definitely will not be using this product again! I might try it again after I have my daughter but my first result was unpleasant and painful.	negatif
2885	22856203	This was my first time trying Yes to mask and I don't really like it. I don't really care much for the burning sensation and it kinda smells weird. It does not smell like coconut like I thought it would. After the 10 minutes was up my face was red but it felt soft. It did hydrate my face but no more than a moisturizer would. I'm not sure if I would buy these products again due to the burning sensation. If you have sensitive skin I would tell you to stay away from these products.	negatif
2886	5076344	barely scented. I love l'occitane products but this was a disservice to the brand... I was hopping to get if not foaming at least a strong scent of lavender but realizing that after the recommended dose there was not even the faintest of scents i gave up.

2929	13276897	I didn't like this product it had such a strong chemical smell that it was burning my eyes. I took it off right when it started to burn. I will not buy or use this product again. I do not recommend.	negatif
2930	19118235	This was a terrible product. As soon as I opened the package, I could smell such a strong chemical smell. It stung and burned the whole time I wore it. Left my face red and burning for an hour afterward. Would not repurchase WHATSOEVER.	negatif
2931	11542047	I really am sensitive to scents in lip products. Very often the Revlon products have a smell that I just find distasteful. The quality of Wet and Wild is not as good, but they do not have the same chemical smell to them.	negatif
2932	17558051	I so wanted to love the Revlon Laquer Balm. They were so drying and smelled awful. It is a strong chemical smell I just could not het past. I purchased mine at Fred Meyer's. I won't be repurchasing this one.	negatif
2933	17281601	Used this product once and removed it after about an hour. It has the worse chemical smell. It's horrible it had literally made me feel sick. I did love the color but nothing could get me to overlook the smell.	negatif
2934	13428328	I didn't like this product. I felt like it was too harsh on my skin and left it drier than other products. Also it has a chemical smell that I don't really like.	negatif
2935	20077078	Even though this says it is a face sunscreen it still irritates my skin so badly. It felt like my skin was on fire and the chemical smell from it was so bad. I had to wash my face multiple times to get it to stop burning and tingling.	negatif
2936	19160921	These are so bad. They have a light chemical smell and they stain your lips. I apply it to my lips and it just crumbles off once it dries. Also dries out my lips so bad. The color is beautiful but I hate the formula	negatif
2937	22796967	Super cheap at $8 per tube of lipstick but made my lips extremely dry making them look wrinkled since the color settled into every line/crease! Even after lip exfoliation and moisturizing them it still looked horrible. The formula is very thin with a chemical smell to it.	negatif
2938	1404606	Last time I bought this product it had no SPF and was oil. Like liquidy, oil. Smelled great! This is more like a gel and has an unpleasant acrid chemical smell to it. Very disappointed as I have been using this stuff for years. Will not be buying this again.	negatif
2939	19028208	Creasless ? Not much. It creases so bad under my eyes . Settles into all my fine lines. Has such a strong chemical smell. And the packaging is terrible .the top that is suppose to wipe off the access product keeps getting stuck in the top , it comes out with way to much product..terrible	negatif
2940	15148578	Was a miss for me. I wasn't too fond of the smell of this shampoo. It had a sort of chemical smell to it which was disappointing because I love the Fekkai hair product line. I only tried once so I couldn't say if it helped in color care.	negatif
2941	1144055	Scent was overwhelming and way too florally and artificial	negatif
2942	22706363	Overwhelming scent. Made my hair sticky and crunchy.	negatif
2943	5132385	I just did not like this scent at all. It was to musty.	negatif
2944	5613448	horrible. This smells like orange kitchen cleaner. You will smell like an orange all day. This was a bad scent choice.	negatif
2945	11422803	didn't really like this it made my lips feel weird and had a bad scent to it. and not the cheapest lipstick either	negatif
2946	16564324	Didn't like the smell. To expensive for what it is. Heavy on hair. Got it at Ulta not stiff. Bad scent	negatif
2947	15152369	Unfortunately this gave me no hydration. I overpaid for a bottle of grape juice and water. It disappointed me beyond belief considering how much I love other Caudalie products! I wish it gave me the hydration I need without that god awful scent.	negatif
2948	24202390	Very moisturising but awful scent! Smells way too heavily of artificial peach so it was a no go for me. I used once and gave to my sister who after her first use binned it as she couldn’t stand the smell either	negatif
2949	16613393	I'm disappointed with this product!!! I had to keep pumping it like 10-12 times in order for it to be absorbed to my hair. It can be a good conditioner but not for a 2-in-1 product. It also has an awful scent to it!!!	negatif
2950	10498072	i hate this setting spray it melts away my makeup and it has an awful scent to it, the fragerence gives me a headache and don't get it twisted i love maybelline but this product was a thumbs down for me	negatif
2951	4851365	lightweight. I was excited to try this product out because of all the good reviews but when I opened the product, there was an awful scent that came with it and it made me feel nauseous. I would not recommend this to a friend.	negatif
2952	5208705	I got this as a sample in a Sephora order and finally got around to trying it. Well, I had to wash my face and start all over again! It's sticky and tacky feeling and had an awful scent. Absolutely the WORST primer I've ever put on my skin.	negatif
2953	17082663	I honestly cannot stand this product. The smell is awful and mixes with my hair oils to produce and more awful scent. I also don't think it does a good job of absorbing my hair oils. I would skip this product for a cheaper alternative that works way better. 	negatif
2954	5172353	Received a sample of this. All I can say is it's a scent that sticks for sure. I tested it on my arm and had to wash it off immediately, I could not stand the smell. It smelled like rotting creamed corn, truly awful scent.	negatif
2955	17475914	This scent really is similar to cough syrup, it was so unpleasant to wear because of the awful scent and taste. Would not recommend this flavor, but does work well for what it is if you enjoy couch syrup.	negatif
2956	13831689	I tried this product but returned it after the first time using it because it was just awful. It gave me no waves, just crunchy sticky hair that looked unwashed. It also has an awful scent to it.	negatif
2957	4713923	Alas! What at first appears to be floral delight turns into stinging nasal woe. I am sure this works for some people, but I surely am not one of them. Quite literally left me with a sinus headache, and the floral notes seem to disappear into a more chemical scent. Didn't seem fitting for 20s.	negatif
2958	12744866	"I picked this mascara up at Ulta when they were having one of their NYX ""Buy 2, Get 1 Free"" sales and I returned it the next day. The fibers were whispy and stung my eyes. The product itself had harsh chemical scent that screamed ""unnatural"". I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money or invest in something better."	negatif
2959	18003112	Womp, womp.&nbsp;This one is a flop for me. It has a slight chemical scent which turned me off right away, and unfortunately it didn't make my makeup last any longer which was what I was going for with this product. The texture is, however, very fine which is nice! I'll use it up, but I won't repurchase.	negatif
2960	13313876	This is honestly one of the worst cleansers that I have ever used. It stings my face, is irritating to my eyes, has a weird chemical scent to it, does not remove any makeup at all from the face, and leaves a soft of film on the face as well, after washing it off. This cleanser doesn't even deserve to be on the market at all!	negatif
2961	23821584	Did not work for my skin at all. It's basically this green cream that reacts with oxygen (i think?) and turns beige-brown. The shade was too dark for my face and looked orange. It also has a strong chemical scent that I really disliked. I still have most of it since I basically only tried it once or twice. 	negatif
2962	18124032	The packaging is super cute. The texture feels like a liquid silicone with a bit of an oily finish. The product is best used by patting the product into the face rather than rubbing it in. There is a bit of a chemical scent left behind during use. My oily skin was not a fan after 15 minutes so I'm guessing this may work better for those that have dry skin.	negatif
2963	7659493	These highlighters look so beautiful when you first apply, but after 2 hours they completely disappear. I was so disappointed in what little time these wore for. They also have a strong chemical scent that kinda alarmed me at first but after applying you can't smell it any more. I would not buy these again. ColourPop Highlighter	negatif
2964	12183701	Did not like smell. After it set it smelt like an old lady perfume. I prefer light blue. Makes you feel young and fresh	negatif
2965	23434553	Not worth it at all!That’s the first 1star review I give a product. I don’t want to be a hater but I have to be honest and say how much I don’t like this product.I bought it from Amazon because I know Aussie is a pretty good brand and I also read some good reviews. However, I really regret getting it. First of all, It does make my hair look clean at all. When I spray it on I feel how wet the spray is. It makes my hair feel dry when I touch it but it doesn’t make it look clean and gives it zero volume l. I did everything according to what the packaging said - sprayed, rubbed with my fingers and then brushed with my hair brush but ai didn’t see the effect. Second of all, it doesn’t smell good. It does gave a sweet sent ... too sweet, it smells like a kid product - like candy. It is not a attractive or elegant smell. Overall... very upset that I purchased it. I won’t be using it again because I feel like it makes me feel like my hair looks even worse than before using this shampoo. It still feels dirty and without volume but thanks to the Aussie dry shampoo it is feels too dry and sticky as well.I purchased it because I didn’t want to pay too much money for a dry shampoo but I guess I got what I payed for... next time I’ll definitely spend more money.	negatif
2966	22671959	just ehhh Where to begin... this mask isn’t anything special and it didn’t really do anything for me, honestly. Luckily my skin didn’t break out (most products with any kind of oil in them make me break out pretty badly) so that’s basically the only good thing about this product. Like someone else said, it smells like sunscreen. Not flat out like sunscreen, but it has a sunscreen smell, but either way, it doesn’t smell good. I got this in my play box and wanted to give it a chance (I have semi sensitive skin so I really liked the idea that this was supposed to be calming, which it wasn’t.. surprise!), so I used it until it was completely gone hoping it’d eventually work, but nothing. It also didn’t do anything for my occasional redness; if anything, it made it worse, so I can’t imagine what it’d do to someone’s skin that’s always red! It does have a really fun texture, though. It’s like, light and airy but also creamy and soft, if that makes any sense! At least it’s fun to put on, if you can stand the smell for the full 10 min. There are MUCH better masks out there that are worth the price tag... this mask isn’t. I won’t be purchasing the full size.	negatif
2967	23759198	Dries out my hair and smells awful. The smell stays in my hair until the next wash and my hair feels terrible and still flaky	negatif
2968	4936626	I tried a sample packet of this. Although it is fairly moisturizing, the smell is an awful rotting smell.	negatif
2969	17077485	I am disapointed with this product. It's awful. The smell and stickiness is like you are putting a hair spray on your face.	negatif
2970	19176621	Hate hate hate. The taste is awful. The smell is awful. It's oily and gets everywhere. Just ew.	negatif
2971	14909198	I'll start off by saying that this face cream is so basic and ordinary and doesn't warrant not even 1/8th of its ridiculous price tag. Second, even if it did work some sort of unicorn-like magic on the skin, the incredibly overpowering scent would keep me away anyway. This actually broke me out in tiny red bumps along my chin and forehead and gave me a headache after an hour because the smell was overwhelming. I literally had to wash it off. I don't understand why people believe that just because a jar of cream costs $200+ that it's going to reverse aging overnight. If that were the case, there would be no wrinkles on anyone, anywhere.	negatif
2972	5413715	This mask is useless.First of all, the scent is overwhelming. So overpowering that it still lingers on my skin after I wash it off. I hate the idea that im using something with so strong chemicals on my face. This perfume really wasnt necessary.Second thing I hate about this mask is that i did not feel like it cleaned my skin. after washing off, my face and my pores looked exactly the same as they did before the mask. My skin felt rough and just..MEH. I would expect it to feel soft but nope.The only nice thing is the glass jar but im more interested in the results ofthe mask than the packaging.I will stick to my beloved Glamglow masks. I refuse to use cheap masks on my face from now on.	negatif
2973	1704407	I was looking for a new dry shampoo to add some volume to my fine hair. This product seemed to fulfill all my needs and I really looked forward to using it. However the scent was overwhelming - way too strong even though I used very little spray. I even tried using my hairdryer to dispel the scent but to no avail. Why do manufacturers think every product needs super strong fragrance? I spend a small fortune on fragrances, and don't need an £8 dry shampoo overpowering my perfume...I would not recommend this if you have an aversion to strong, too floral/chemical smells or prefer to smell of your preferred perfume choice!!	negatif
2974	4989202	I got this in my Sephora play box and really wanted to like it for days when I'm running late with no time to straighten or curl my hair. Maybe my hair is too fine or too long but it did nothing for me but make it feel like wire! My hair is naturally very soft and I can usually get away without washing for 3-4 days. I had to wash it that night because of the texture & scent! I'd put it on my freshly wased hair. The scent is lovely but OVERWHELMING!!!! It gave me a headache because it was so overpowering. Within 30 mins my head was pounding. Never again. I'm giving the rest of the sample away.	negatif
2975	1147091	The lid, labeling, and jar were different from every other time I have bought this product. The labeling also was different. It was not embossed on the jr. It was stickers that were in crooked. Also had a bad taste when it touched my lips which I have never experienced before. Don't believe this was Oil Of Olay.	negatif
2976	7814256	This is one of the most offensive scents created. It smells like a mass appeal chemical bomb. It seems to never end. The bottle is just a bland as the scent inside. It smells like high school and bad taste. I don't know why it's so popular. It would be improved by going away.	negatif
2977	4853658	oily, chemical smell. What a great concept this is. However, the formula has such a heavy chemical smell, I felt like I was rubbing something really toxic on my mouth. Because its on your lips, I got the occasional taste of it too, and boy is it unpleasant. Just awful. I'm surprised that in an era where brands are skewing more natural this product was developed. I'm not someone who buys exclusively all natural or organic: I don't care what in it, just as long as it works! But I think they missed the mark big time, it just smells like something that shouldn't be near your body, let alone your mouth.	negatif
2978	5927971	This brush was absolutely PERFECT for contouring and highlighting until I washed it...after I wet it and cleaned it with my beauty blender soap it started emitting a weird stale chemical smell. I hoped it would go away after drying but nope...its even worse. This was the perfect brush to fit in the hollows of my cheeks for contouring but sadly bringing this thing anywhere near my face is just unthinkable now considering how gross the smell is. I tried to hold my breath while contouring but unfortunately the gross chemical smell is just too much to handle. I'm upset because of how much I spent on it and don't have the heart to throw it out...so I've left it in my random box of junk never to be used again...	negatif
2979	1125858	Did not like the smell, does not last long, and too expensive	negatif
2980	1302305	As far as hand cream goes it was nice but I did not like the smell	negatif
2981	23311416	Did not like the smell, felt like it left my skin looking cakey	negatif
2982	70443	i dont know if its because i bought a bad one or they just genuinely smell awful	negatif
2983	1423325	I ordered one last month and there is a bad strong chemical smell coming off it when I open the stick.p Not going to use this. I bought the last one from a drugstore and there was no such smell. I really like this product but the one I got seems like an expired or bad batch. There are no returns available from this seller.	negatif
2984	1281247	Terrible! I was looking for a drug store cleansing oil because I love the Tatcha cleansing oil but it’s quite expensive. I used this one time and my skin broke out so bad. I rarely ever have skin break outs so knew immediately it was the oil. Also it has a terrible chemical smell. Returned it to the store for refund.	negatif
2985	7704406	I am an advocate of most UD products. Naked Skin however I am not, having the upmost high hopes for the product I was highly disappointed in this foundation. I like medium to full coverage this foundation was extremely thin and seperated on the face. The over powering chemical smell was horrible. I do not recommend UD naked skin.	negatif
2986	5218547	Anyone else have a problem with it smelling like chemicals? I couldn't use this I loved the color so much I got the shade miso pretty but i couldn't wear it for any longer than five minute it gave me the worst headache ever, to much of a chemical smell, I'll stick with too faced peach lip oil, till this is fixed	negatif
2987	8294476	I'm not sure if mine was a bad batch or what. I was so excited to try this and ordered one online. I opened it and had the worst chemical smell. I tried it on to see if I could get pasted the smell. I think I lasted 30 min without wiping it off. I ended up returning it. I have enough lips that I would rather use.	negatif
2988	5420068	Left a burning, painful sensation on my face immediately upon use. Lasted the whole night. Woke up to dry, scaly skin and bumps all over my forehead. Worst reaction Iâ€™ve had to a cleanser, ever! Additionally, has a horrible chemical smell. If you have sensitive/reactive skin, stay away!	negatif
2989	12612142	Tried this lotion for a few days and liked the way it felt on the skin at first. It has a chemical smell that I do not care for and the skin did not feel moisturized after a short period of time... Need to reapply constantly which I do not need to do with other lotions or creams I have used. I will not be buying the full size.	negatif
2990	15827760	I was not a big fan of this product for several reasons some of those being it is a little bit difficult to use and is not very comfortable it irritated my eyes and it also has a strong chemical smell the concept is nice but the overall product I would not recommend you could definitely find other products that would work better than listed for the same price if not cheaper	negatif
2991	23080984	I did not like anything about this product. The gloss is pretty sticky, the color is extremely streaky, and there is a strong chemical smell that fades away very slowly. The only pro I found was the range of shades in the collection, but with a formula like this, it really wasn't much use to have such nice shades.	negatif
2992	7261566	"I am giving this one stars as last year I bought this for my birthday and I honestly cannot stand the smell. It has a very weird chemical smell as far as I'm concerned. It did hold my makeup in place the few different times I used it though. I hope mine wasn't the only one that had this weird ""smell"". This was a ""regret it"" product for me!"	negatif
2993	9667813	This did not help me at all. First of all, the primer is greasy. I already have oily skin so this did not help. It creased all over the place. I waited for the primer dry a bit before applying my eyeshadow but it was a mess. Second, It smells awful to me. Too much of a chemical smell to it. 	negatif
2994	11494597	These are terrible. Do not waste your money. I usually love Maybelline lip products so I was very disappointed. The formula is sticky and thick and smells awful. Kind of a fruity- chemical smell. And these are NOT matte at all. They are shiny. These are pigmented lip glosses. If you are wanting a cheap matte lippie- try Maybelline's creamy matte lipsticks , they are much better.	negatif
2995	9838182	This doesn't erase pores. This pills up on the skin really bad. It's got such a weird texture to it, too. I would honestly just spend the money on a high end primer. I am not a fan whatsoever and it has this weird chemical smell to it. The only positive is the price point.	negatif
2996	11992055	I really wanted to like this. It went on smooth, was a beautiful color, didn't smear and dried down really fast. The only reason it got one star was the smell. I don't know if it was just mine or a normal thing but the chemical smell was so strong that I got a headache and started gagging. I took it off within 5 minutes.	negatif
2997	22935784	This is horrible! Smells like bathroom cleaner.Unbelievable that Amazon are selling this CHEAP FAKE COPY as the genuine product!This will be forwarded to Trading standards who will be notified as this is most definitely NOT ORIGINAL!!Don't waste your money.... buy original from a proper retailer.There is a horrible nauseating chemical smell.... which won't wash off!!	negatif
2998	23334261	Not Worth it This primer is not worth $38! I received this product in a Boxycharm and while I was happy that I received it, it was just meh. it has a weird chemical smell, I didn't notice that it did anything to make my foundation stay longer plus it wasn't even that luminizing to me, instead it made me look a little Greasy. I would not repurchase this product.	negatif
2999	4809835	I'm going to be returning this. It was recommended by a manager to use on my sensitive skin. It irritates my eyes and other sensitive areas of my face. It also fails to remove all the makeup and leaves my face feeling greasy with makeup rubbing off still after cleaning. Also has a chemical smell. Stick to drugstore removers or go for something like the soy makeup remover from Fresh.	negatif
3000	22697677	I wanted to like this... Sadly, this gets a 1 star review. While the consistency of the formula was decent, the color looked like the frosted pink lipstick from the early 2000s. Just awful. It also had a funny chemical smell to it that did not seem to go away. Ended up returning in the store.	negatif
3001	16807907	I ordered this thinking it would be soothing and smell fresh. Wrong. This smells horribly, to the point where I can’t even use it. It has a very strong, chemical smell, sort of like grandma’s strong soapy smelling perfume. I have the coconut milk cleanser and it’s very nice.	negatif
3002	5841330	First I'll say this brush picks up and lays down highlighter alright... however, this brush had the most rancid chemical smell. The bristles feel soft to the touch but when applying product to my cheeks they felt rough and gross. Feels way to cheap to cost $28. I don't like this brush at all! I'm going to return it for sure.	negatif
3003	23769162	So it's an understatement to say I was disappointed when I got this. I currently dont have my makeup bag with me so I can't tell you the shade I have but first I put it on and it is so streaky. Second, it was the worst chemical smell which means you can taste it. It's just the most disgusting thing I've put on my mouth.	negatif
3004	10790963	I didn't like this at all. It had a very strange, almost chemical smell. It didn't apply well, and had to be really worked into the skin to absorb. I have a lot of dark spots on my face and I didn't see any effects to those either. For the expensive prices, there are much better sun screens out there.	negatif
3005	4801853	Maybe it just didn't mesh well with my body chemistry, but I hated this scent. It was very off-putting with an odd chemical smell. I bought it blind based on the great reviews and listed notes but that was a big mistake. The original Romance is infinitely better. If you want a great ginger-based scent go for the amazing Les des Vignes by Caudalie.	negatif
3006	15881337	Horrible chemical smell which is hard to ignore since it lingers. Got this product at my local drugstore hoping for an age defying miracle even though I'm only 25 i haven't seen much changes in my sensitive caucasian skin. The first few times i even felt a slight burning sensation. Nice packaging is all this product as going for it.	negatif
3007	2505957	Received this today and it is awful! The colour is definitely not light ivory, it is very orange! Mine also had some clear liquid that had a very strong chemical smell in it, that seeped out of the tube when I tried to squeeze it! I definitely won't be putting this anywhere near my face! Going straight in the bin!!!	negatif
3008	20292769	I got this as part of 500 point box. Not only does this have an unpleasant chemical smell but it also made my face break out in small white heads. It’s not a light moisturizer, feels like it sits on top of your skin. Doesn’t absorb well at all. Just screams hello dust/dirt	negatif
3009	910957	I used the product for years and loved it. The new scent is horrible. I thought my bottle was rancid, I bought another bottle and same awful smell. Don't waste your money like I did.	negatif
3010	4919118	I will be returning this product today. I wanted something for light coverage because I don't prefer to put make up all over my face day to day. However, this product is VERY oily and makes my already oily face look wet. It also has an AWFUL smell that reminds me of fish and chemicals.	negatif
3011	6205115	It smells... It works yes but smells! I think I'm just sensitive to smells but big turn off. With so many competitors out there they can't really afford to lose costumers with that awful smell. I wouldn't buy it again... In fact where do I go for a refund?	negatif
3012	7768031	Don't get my wrong this setting spray is great, it literally makes your makeup last throughout the day. The spray also gives your makeup a matte finish and is very lightweight. Unfortunately, the spray has an awful smell and I just can't use it anymore.	negatif
3013	4806075	Not a fan of this product at all. It dries very odd, it's sticky and drying. Not to mention, it has an awful smell and taste. The colors LOOK very beautiful and pigmented, but they are not. I will never buy these again and yes, I made the mistake of buying all three once.	negatif
3014	5218045	This product not only made me break out more, but made my acne more noticeable and red. I have dry skin but bad acne in my T zone and chin, this dried out my skin more, and the moisturizer didn't really leave my skin soft and moisturized. Awful smell as well.	negatif
3015	2002053	1 star so I can write a review. Sending this back it's not the right stuff. It's a white cream with a awful smell . The proper cream is a peach gel. Do not buy!!!!	negatif
3016	12848387	Terrible. Awful smell. And once I got past that i found that it made my skin very greasy! It also caused me to break out and that was just after 3 uses. I threw this away and will not repurchase.	negatif
3017	15884260	I used this product awhile back and when I opened it i was hit in the face with an awful smell and when I applied it to my face it burned! My face was bright red for 3 days !	negatif
3018	18070551	I hate this stuff. My skin feels super sticky afterwards and it has this awful smell to it. I find it doesn't provide a matte effect or even help with the longevity of my makeup. I'd rather just spend more money on a good setting spray than this one.&nbsp;	negatif
3019	5172383	scented. This soap smells TERRIBLE to me. I think it smells like dog food. I would recommend smelling this in store before punching online to see if the scent bothers you. If it wasn't for the awful smell, I think i would like the soap, but I had to throw it away.	negatif
3020	25336145	Awful smell, strange muddy colour for a toner and I can’t tell if my face is clean because the cotton pad is always muddy from the product. Doesn’t tone the skin. It has a very sticky feeling, and no moisturizer can get absorbed after using this toner. Just awful.	negatif
3021	23327293	Terrible smell! It applies unevenly and wants to streak. It leaves your skin looking like you have plastic wrap on your skin. The worst part is the awful smell. I wanted to like it so much, but it's going into my makeup graveyard drawer.	negatif
3022	4784278	The first thing i noticed when i bought it was the awful smell. It didn't do much for my skin either it took so many coats just to get a decent amount of coverage and i was still never really satisfied with the amount of coverage it provided. I had to return it!	negatif
3023	15890389	I am not into the Wild Rose line. It smells awful. The serum and the eye cream is pointless. It used religiously and nothing changed. Total waste of money and suffered through the awful smell. Do Not recommend.	negatif
3024	18345770	Just being honest but this smells like it was just pulled from the bottom of a pond. I didn't see any difference in my skin and I could not get over the smell. Such an expensive product for such an awful smell and no results.	negatif
3025	3056604	Dont buy!! It has hardly any scent and is a cheap old product. Buy a better stronger spray like davidoff coolwater or Eternity but this is awful. Smell lasts about 3 seconds!! My wife burst out laughing at it!!	negatif
3026	9210988	I hate hate hate the smell of lavender I tried to use dream cream but couldn't get past that smell lingering on my body after. it's an ok product and does moisturize but I'd rather do without that God awful smell	negatif
3027	5217843	I couldn't get past the smell and the smoke cloud it left me in. I def wasn't expecting the suffocating cloud of dust. I washed my hair and couldn't get that awful smell out for 2 days :(	negatif
3028	19224438	It smells awful. I can't even comment on the quality of this (which is fine) because when I put it on my face, I just smell Play-Do all day. There are so many other cream highlighters you can use without the awful smell. Save your money.	negatif

3050	24673827	Poor quality product! Awful, strong scent, burns if it gets anywhere near eyes & does not remove makeup very well at all. Also leaves a sticky residue on my face!	negatif
3051	4808863	I usually love all Clinique products and I have actually tried this same product but the purple bottle which worked great. My skin changed a bit so I decided to change my skin products as well. The product itself is great just like the purple bottle, but the smell is horrible. I literally plug my nose to avoid smelling that awful scent.	negatif
3052	4973115	I purchased Park Ave Princess, a neutral/pink color, which I think would look good on most... but I could not get past the awful scent. It seems other reviewers have also noticed. It reminded me of gasoline?? A shame a pretty color had to be sent back. Not worth it, even on sale.	negatif
3053	1186140	Doesn't Absorb Well,Too Greasy Or Heavy I have combo/oily skin...my cheeks are dry..now that I am older . But in my oily section its oily/flaky at the same time..and I can break out all over still. This just sits on top of my dry areas and does not absorb. It makes it feel gross. If you have extremely dry skin this may work? I am also not a fan of the scent. does not smell like any sort of roses to me...more like some sort of flower tea. Will be returning and buying garnier moisture bomb instead.	negatif
3054	1260969	I was so excited to try this, I was obsessed with Herbal Essence when I was younger. The smell was horrible, I hate perfume and it did NOT smell like the old shampoos I couldn’t get enough of. I prefer a cream shampoo, usually clear shampoos are harsher on my hair. I wish it was sulfate free, it made me nervous for my delicate, colored hair. I wouldn’t go out and buy this I recommend it. It’s a bummer after being so excited about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
3055	16807981	I received a sample from Yves Saint Laurent. Not my cup of tea. This smells musky. I do not like musky scents. It was also a little on sweet smelling side and it gave me a headache. Smells more suitable for an older woman also. Not a youthful scent. I would not recommend this perfume if you prefer light scents and or are sensitive to certain smells. This does not smell like lavender but, lavender has the same effect on me and if you're the type of person who is sensitive to lavender...then this may also give you the same sensitivity.	negatif
3056	5595920	I am sooooo disappointed. This spray used to be my ride or die. It set my makeup perfectly and didn't budge.. HOWEVER it appears UD changed the formula because it stinks!!! It smells like pickles..and garbage? Idk, hard to describe- almost like it has gone bad. While it may still work and set the makeup, I'd rather my face not smell like something died on it. I wonder if maybe they took out an added fragrance..? Idk, but I can't spray it without gagging so I'm on to another setting spray! Just my .02!	negatif
3057	5185651	I was really excited about the peach palette especially because of all the good reviews! But I can not stand the smell! I guess it's just me? Everyone seems to love the smell and think it really smells like a real peach. Well,it does not smell like any of the sweet yummy peaches I've come across in my opinion. So basically I'm really disappointed is the scent which was the main reason I purchased it. The smell. It reminds me of some chalky flavored medicine tablet for kids. Or some hookah flavor I've tried before; that I didn't care for. The shades were ok. Some were not very pigmented. Sadly, not worth the hype and will be returning.	negatif
3058	6059750	The original Saint is one of my favorite fragrances. I've been using it since it's launch and when it was no longer available from Sephora, I was able to stockpile a few bottles of it when it was brought back on the KVD beauty site. I use the og version every day, and I was so thrilled that they were relaunching a new version that was going to be the same scent. When I got my new bottle, I was so incredibly disappointed. This does not smell like the original Saint at all. The sparkling sweet vanilla note that the original fragrance has is completely missing here; the new version is a generic white floral scent that is not my cup of tea. If you're buying this expecting it to smell the same as the original, as advertised, you will be disappointed.	negatif
3059	3102402	My husband bought this from here as a gift for me. Angel is my favourite fragrance have worn it for years always and always bought from high street retailers. The perfume in this box is awful ..it does not smell like proper angel has a strange smell..doesn't linger in the room afterwards like the proper fragrance does and certainly doesn't remain on the the skin as it should, fades straight away, struggle to smell anything, I even went into a hight street store had a test there to compare them and this one must be an imitation of the real thing. The set looks nice but nothing smells as it should do. A real dissapointment...would not recommend	negatif
3060	18450744	I feel like I’m not even using the same product as the others? I have very dry and fine long hair and was looking for a new leave in conditioner after one of mine ran out. This does not smell like the other drybar products, but I would be willing to dismiss the strange smell (smells like men’s aftershave to me) if it actually worked. It makes my hair feel goopy, and it actually gives a crazy amount of frizzy volume. The first few times I used it I thought it was my hair needing a cut badly, but I used something else the other day and my hair went back to normal. Sorry. really can’t recommend if you have my hair type!	negatif
3061	2629018	I've been racking my brains as to where I've smelt this product before and I've finally worked out what it is, it smells exactly like the spray hairdressers put on your hair before they cut it!! It does smell clean, like alcohol with a bit of cheap perfume thrown in, it does not smell like lavender or chamomile at all, I can't use it, it's too chemically to spray on my pillow, I'm either going to bin it or give it away...If you want a true pillow mist go for Neom Tranquility pillow mist, it, pricey but totally worth it.	negatif
3062	5830585	The rating is for the packaging. This product comes in very very cheap feeling containers & when I purchased mine it was cracked. The mini duo is supposed to be travel friendly but it does not seem it when the packaging can't withstand shipping. ALTHOUGH the product inside the mini containers deserves a full five stars! I can't put the Sunshine Oil down with its uplifting fragrance of sweet citrus. The Cooling Water is utterly the most refreshing thing I have ever rubbed onto my cleansed face, & for the smell it really does not smell like anything even when applied to the skin.	negatif
3063	6207467	heavy, strong, floral, not aquatic, not very long-lasting. I bought this perfume before testing it but I did read the description, reviews & the notes. While I'm not that good with fragrance notes, the description did imply that this would be a light, delicate and Pure floral perfume with some aquatic element to it. Since Issey is one of my favorite designers & I've been really loving aquatic perfumes lately, it seemed like a good choice at the time to get the 100 ml bottle. I was looking for something light & aquatic that I could wear to university in the summer. The scent actually isn't that bad, but it is too heavy and strong. Definitely headache-inducing. I thought it would get lighter after spraying it. The scent gets weaker (fades), but it stays really heavy. It did not smell aquatic at all. This should be marketed as a floral perfume & while it's not as intense as sth like Flowerbomb, it is definitely not a light and delicate fragrance. Overall, this isn't necessarily a bad scent, it just wasn't for me & did not live up to my expectations. One thing i liked about this, however, was the spray itself. It feels really well-made and sprays the perfume extremely finely and evenly. It's so satisfying to use. Also, the bottle looks really cool but that about it.	negatif

3066	5605366	I really wanted to like this due to the earlier rave reviews, however this product made my hair look dirtier than before, made it look crispy and although the smell initially is pleasant, after about 10 seconds, you end up smelling like you just poured a bottle of grandma's (bad) perfume on your head. No Bueno!	negatif
3067	4738525	I purchased Tom Ford Eau de Toilette after smelling it in a magazine (never purchase a fragrance based on what it smells like in a magazine, you will be disappointed.) I ordered this right away - put it on immediately. Hated it/Loved it/Hated it.Wore it to work the next day just so that I could really judge the fragrance.it starts off smelling weird - then settles into the scent that I smelled in the magazine - and afterwards smells horrible, like I just stepped into an incense shop.I like incense, but,.... I don't wanna smell like it.I returned this one for Tom Ford White Patchouli, which smelled beautiful in the store, horrible on me. Will also be returning that one.Can anyone please tell me why Tom Ford makes these incredibly expense perfumes that smell like a horrible incense shop???Really I wanted to love this so badly...	negatif
3068	1258821	Even though other reviews gave this five stars... After six cycles of chemotherapy, I have become sensitive to certain odd-fragrances. This Clean Comfort bar soap smelled pretty good in that package at a brick-and-mortar store, but upon opening and trying in the shower, the fragrance had changed, and left a lingering horrible chemical-scent, after-the-fact. Kind of like a bad after-taste. It also left a funny-feeling residue on my skin. I have returned it to Amazon and will go back to mild-scented Ivory Aloe.	negatif
3069	5088114	I was really excited about this palette but it was such a disappointment. Horrible pigmentation and quality. The shadows are so patchy and have so much fall out. It also has a HORRIBLE chemical scent, nothing like the chocolate scent in the other Chocolate palettes, it made me gag. The pans are also super tiny, the size of a thumbnail. I would be okay with the size if the quality was up to par. If you missed out on this, consider yourself lucky. I own drugstore eyeshadow better than this.	negatif
3070	15630453	My mom got this for me for Christmas years ago and I did like it for a while but..while wearing it I would get headaches cuz it was too strong for me going from floral to a chemical scent....soo badly to the point of I ended up throwing out the bottle....the perfume had turned!!!! **I had given this one another shot about two years after having it the 1st time and same thing the perfume turned on me	negatif
3071	25678293	I’ve been using this scent for 5-6 years now and i can tell that the one you’ve sold me is a fake. The scent is supposed to be a light, musky, summery fragrance but this one is just has a pure chemical scent that is way too strong and unpleasant.I feel so ripped off, I knew there are fakes being sold on Amazon and the only reason I felt safe buying this product was because it was listed as ‘Amazon’s choice’.	negatif
3072	4955582	This powder has to be my all time least favourite makeup product. I had so much trouble to even get the powder to come out of the jar!! This product leaves a bright white sheen on your face and no matter how many times you take your brush and try to wipe off the powder, it still remains stuck. It also has a strong chemical scent which I hate. Whatever you do, just don't take pictures while you have this powder on your face!! I love mufe but this product is horrible.	negatif
3073	19843116	This does give the skin a beautiful glow when applied to the skin. I have found that you need a lot of product to get the powder to really sink into the skin. Also the spray is very intense. You have to hold it a full arms length away to get a mist but then it is harder to get the amount of product needed. It also has a slight chemical scent which I am not a fan of.	negatif
3074	19659157	Nothing like what I imagined This smells nothing like any of the other Atelier perfumes; it has a very distinct vegetable-like smell mixed with a mossy-smelling wood on the verge of decay. It is in no way a like any other floral I have ever smelled and I was quite frankly repulsed when I first smelled it; I was immediately stick with an impression of what I can only liken to decaying celery. I think the Gaiac Wood is much too heavy, and perhaps it does have an orange-esque note upon drying, like the few fans of this strange scent have attested, however, its detection is faint if anything and it is in no way enough to combat the incredibly overpowering musty wood and food disposal scent which instantly barrages the senses. In other words, I do not like this scent, nor would I recommend it to anyone in search of a floral perfume, especially when the brand has other beautifully crafted scents.	negatif

Pros : Bueatiful formula, very hydrating, not sticky at all, and didn't find it to have a bad taste or smell. The applicator was nice and soft, and the packaging was beautiful. Cons : There was no color payoff at all. I mean it was like I added clear lipgloss to my lips. The price was just too much for what you really get. I returned it.	negatif

3106	4830522	I bought two, and they smell like rotting garbage. One is worse than the other, so I think they're actually going bad, it's not just the smell. (I JUST bought them) Checked out the testers today, and only the darker shades didn't have that awful smell, maybe because they aren't being opened as much. I think these go bad really quickly.	negatif
3107	19634096	Gross! This cream smells like a harsh household cleaner and I feel disgusted when I try to apply it to my face.

3108	16671169	I really wanted to like this product but the one I got had a really awful smell to it. The smell was so strong and bad that I couldn't even keep it on my face for long.

3109	19227447	I thought that this would be a light weight moisturizer with SPF for oily skin but this is straight up too oily. It also smells and feels like sunscreen!

You're better off getting regular sunscreen lol!	negatif
3110	4775862	stinky!. The first Bumble and Bumble product I tried was the coconut conditioner and I loved it. It was creamy and left my hair soft and smelling great.

3121	15764215	I hate these products because a lot of them don't dry down all the way and they smell awful	negatif
3122	1280676	I want to start by saying i was not impressed by this product. I would prefer a standard conditioner over this foam one any day. Like most products in a container like this they tend to have a chemical smell which I'm not fond of that masked the true smell of the product. As far as how it preformed it left my hair rather dry, striping all the moisture out of my hair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
3123	1284640	The chemical smell is aweful, but this product isn't returnable. Also, according to some sources, retinol should only be used at night, since it can cause damage to the skin when exposed to the sun (so you should also avoid any products that combine retinol with sunscreen). But then even though the information on the box says this product has retinol, the ingredients don't list it. So, in short, this product is worthless.	negatif
3124	855965	I bought this product a few days ago and am not very happy with it. When I opened it, it had a strong chemical smell to it and when trying to apply it felt as if the bottle was almost out of product. It was hard to get a decent amount of mascara on the brush, felt as if you were getting towards the end of a mascara bottle and were trying to scrape together what was left for your last couple of uses.	negatif
3125	1021044	I had a pretty severe allergic reaction to this cleanser. It definitely melts your makeup off but it melts your skin off too. I have very oily skin and after using this my skin is dry, flaky, and peeling. My neck is completely red and raw and my face is puffy. This cleanser has a very strong smell, like a chemical smell, and I think the fragrance may be the problem. I''m miserable right now with my raw itchy skin :(	negatif
3126	1305623	True To Color Bad Tasting,Smells Bad I usually love the Too Faced Melted Matte formula, but I just purchased the Drop Dead Red on 02/24/2018, well I just tried to use it today (03-01-2018), and the smell was so bad I had to instantly take it off!!! I have so many liquid lips, and I have never smelled one with such a strong chemical smell before like this one. I will be returning to Ulta tomorrow!	negatif
3127	4753254	I was so excited to try this foundation, but sadly - it just didn't work for me. I forced myself to look past the spray paint chemical smell, but it just made my dry skin look horrible. Even after mixing a beauty oil with it, I still couldn't make this foundation look half way decent. I ended up returning it after a week of trying, every application method I knew.	negatif
3128	15244023	had my expectations very high for this product but ended up being very disappointed. packaging is gorgeous and the product is smudge proof which was nice the actual brush is very straight and the bristles are very spikey. did nothing for my lashes at all for volume possibly the tiniest bit of length was added but did not separate my lashes whatsoever. worst part is the chemical smell that is very overbearing when opened, which for me made my eyes water for the first 10 minutes after i applied. would not recommend this to anyone in my opinion, i will be returning.	negatif
3129	7705520	I couldn't fall in love with this foundation no matter how many times I tried. The coloring is so off. It will start out looking great but as the day progressed it started to turn gray around my mouth and nose. It's a natural finish foundation with buildable medium coverage. It has a strong almost chemical smell as well. I really didn't like anything about this product except the sleek foundation.	negatif
3130	9619878	i got the black shade 'perversion'. i can say that i did not like this product at all. it was very watery. it did have a very small tip but found that it was too small. very hard to fill in the wing. to me it also had a very strong chemical smell. i would not buy this one again. i do love urban decay products but i just think they missed the mark on this one.	negatif
3131	5138141	I was sooooo excited for these. I'm tired of matte and my usual reds and brown lipsticks. I just bought the Marc Jacobs lip creamed which are amazing. I. Ought in these the papa don't peach, tickle me peach and peach tease and 1) they smell gross. It's a super powerful chemical smell which is nauseating and 2) they don't last all all. I should have listened to the you tubers I watch.. don't waste your money. They are all going back	negatif
3132	18848713	I received a sample of this in my Ipsy bag this year. I hated it! It immediately burned my lips and not just tingling, it hurt like bee stings! I had to take it off right away. My lips did plump up a bit but were red and it felt awful. I would never purchase or use this product again. It smelled awful, a strong chemical smell. I actually threw it away after using one time, sadly. 	negatif
3133	1901653	This cannot be the true original perfume - no lasting fragrance, an underlying chemical smell - and it is making my wrists itch! The bottle is the colour for the EDT not the EDP, but even allowing for some changes there by Guerlain, the perfume just isn't right....I guess I should have known that something selling for £40 less than mainstream store prices wasgoing to be fake. I cannot recommend this source to anyone.	negatif
3134	5401329	Contains oxybenzone.This stuff is is sticky, greasy, and reeks of that chemical smell I used to hate as a child when my mom would put sunscreen all over me before going to the pool. It left my face looking like an oil spill for the entire day. Perhaps the only good things I can say about it are that it does not leave a white cast on my skin and that it has a high PA rating. But there are other sunscreens out there which accomplish the same thing with a better texture.	negatif
3135	3305006	This cream has a nasty chemical smell and I do not want to use it on my face. I have not come across the smell in other Clinique products. I find it a little greasy for my skin but this is not surprising as I bought it by mistake instead of Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief which is a lovely moisturiser with a very appealing feel. Big mistake. I might take it to a Clinique counter to see what they say.	negatif
3136	5661873	Product arrived quickly enough. I ordered the Lolita colour which looked a nice nude pinky colour from the picture. When it arrived, it was an awful murky brown colour. Absolutely nothing like the description or the picture. On opening, it has an unpleasant chemical smell & the colour on my lips is pretty awful. Staying power was also very poor. I'm actually very doubtful that this is a genuine L'Oréal product at all. Save your money & buy from a shop where you know what you are getting. Disappointed.	negatif
3137	22611277	Okay so NO! NYX has some good products but this one was not good. It has a weird chemical smell and made my eyes itchy whenever I applied it to my lashes. It also feels grainy. Like the dried bits of mascara was getting in my eyes. However, I give it a star because i liked the brush applicator. It's soft and I'm sure if it was paired with better formula it would have been a great product.	negatif
3138	16620703	This is THE WORST lipstick I have ever tried. It has a very chemical smell. It isn't too strong, but strong enough you can catch a faint scent once in a while. I have to say the pigmentation is VERY good... But it bleeds everywhere and leaves my lips bone dry as heck. It emphasizes my lines and while it is completely waterproof, it isn't worthwhile in the least. Applying also feels like your rubbing a piece of dried up eraser on your lips - except drier.	negatif
3139	16646983	I have been colouring my hair for about 20 years and this is the absolute worst product I have ever used. Ever!It is messy, uneven, does not saturate the hair the foam is so light that it can easily fly off the glove and onto every surface you own. I've tried this twice now and I hate it so much. Oh, and it's chemical smell is strong and awful. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.	negatif
3140	22583195	I personally did not like this shampoo. First the smell/perfume of the shampoo was very potent and not very good. It had a smell of rotting flowers with a hint of chemical smell. Second the shampoo dried my hair out. I would rather continue using the previous shampoo I was using. This is not a product I would recommend. I received this product free from influenster for testing purposes. [product:l'oréal-paris-everpure-blonde-shampoo]	negatif
3141	1453656	I used this while in 30 degrees Barcelona, it was so thick and did not absorb at all, it sat onto of my skin all day leaving my face and chest feeling super sticky and clammy.My BF who has dry skin had trouble with this also, it would leave white streaks across your face and left little white balls on my BF stubble.It had a horrible chemical smell to it.It is completely opposite to what it advertised.	negatif
3142	9845805	I was super excited when I got the chance to buy this foundation, due to it's well known popularity. First off, this foundation has a strong chemical smell that I find to be annoying after a while, it looks very obvious on the face, and it just feels so heavy, like my pores are being severely clogged with this stuff. I ended up trashing this foundation, as never will I ever buy it again!	negatif
3143	17704812	The only thing I liked about this foundation was how perfect the shade was to my skin tone, other than that I don't really have anything good to say. The coverage was great but the texture of the foundation wasn't what I was looking for and there was this weird chemical smell that came from the foundation and it really irritated my skin and almost felt like it was burning. Since I started using this I noticed a change in my skin and it was not for the better. I think I'll just stick to my normal foundation	negatif
3144	4832051	I really wanted to love this foundation, because I had heard great things about other stick foundations. Although I love the convenience of the stick, the chemical smell of this product turned me off. The foundation goes on nicely, but even after setting powder my face looked like a greasy mess (my skin ranges from normal to dry). Throughout the day it gets worse. I would come home from work with makeup that looked cakey in some spots and like it was melting off in other spots! Not cool. I wouldn't recommend this product.	negatif
3145	5078003	I bought this because I loved the way the swatch looked on my hand but when I put it on my lips all I smelled was a sweet fragrance failing to mask a chemical smell. It also tastes nasty. (Side note: It's way worse than L'Oréal Paris lipsticks, I can tolerate those.) I couldn't leave it on for more than a few minutes. Now I know to smell a lipstick before I buy it.	negatif
3146	15297854	I religiously buy the bare minerals powders they are sooo good on my skin but this is literally THE WORST foundation I have ever bought. It has a really strange chemical smell to it and doesn't cover skin imperfections just highlights wrinkles etc it's sooo oily just totally bizarre to be honest I actually considered taking it back in store as it was so bad I thought it had been tampered with. Don't buy this!!!!!	negatif
3147	6185974	The smell of the face wash is really strong and unpleasant. I would avoid using it if you have allergies or sensitive skin. The pink silicone scrubber is very rough on skin and pulls it. The stick with the black stuff also has a very gross chemical smell (like elmers school glue), and when I rinsed it off, it was stuck in pores all over my face. It made my skin look awful. Products inside did nothing they claimed.	negatif
3148	22667848	chemical smell, and disappointing Bought this product right when it released super excited looks beautiful online got it in, smells like chemical and is really wet and once on sticky, and doesn’t look like the picture at all it’s very sheer, so I put on a base color a lilac purple hoping it would change, yes it looked better but it was still super sticky and moved my previous fully dried down liquid lip.	negatif
3149	3193877	If I could of given this no stars I would have. Looks good in the bottle and there's a very small hint of the normal fragrance but it disappears quickily and all you can smell is a chemical smell. It smells nothing like the actual perfume when you put it on. This has to be a fake!Very disappointed that Amazon are selling this. Luckily I got a refund but it isn't the point. I won't be buying perfume from Amazon again.	negatif
3150	19624600	so disappointing! I'm a huge fan of Becca palettes and this one just falls short. The colors look gorgeous but quality wise they don't compare to past palettes. The pigmentation on the lids isn't as good, neither is the blendability. They clearly changed the formula on this one, cutting corners, used sub par ingredients and made it in China (which all other palettes have been made is USA). Probably why this one has a strong chemical smell to it. Please stop cutting corners and bring back the old formulation!	negatif
3151	22659878	Unwavering Chemical Smell Product smells generally do not bother me, but OH MY WORD. These are just.... Really bad. I thought it was possibly that the first one I opened had just gone off, but it was all of them, and is apparently just part of the formulation. The smell does not fade either. As long as the product isn't completely removed or worn off, that smell is there. What happened to the mild vanilla or other scented bite lip products?!	negatif
3152	8747545	I did not like this mask at all. First off it had a horrible chemical smell to it made my eyes water. I was so excited to use this and was very disappointed. I did not notice any difference in my skins at all! Another thing was you had to use a lot of product to and it was very difficult to peel off. It peeled off in flakes which made it take a long time. Do not buy i returned mine.	negatif
3153	14286600	I bought this product with high hopes because a number of youtubers that I watch love Cover FX. I've been looking for a new foundation that matches me and they have a great array of options and tones to choose from. First off, it's stinky, very chemical smell. Second, it's cakey to the max. Even after setting it with a powder, it never really set. It wipes off very easily...RIP my boyfriends white shirt. Anyways, I returned it. The lady at sephora said she had heard bad things about it as well.	negatif
3154	14401942	I recently tried this combination after coloring my hair and I must say, I didnt care for it. The shampoo and conditioner both have quite a chemical smell and are a little runny compared to other shampoos and conditioners. It washes out looking just like hair dye and leaves an oily feel to my hair. My hair feels like it wasn't even washed right after using these products. I wouldn't recommend them.	negatif
3155	19069305	Not my fave gloss. They have a chemical smell to them not appealing to apply to the lips. Because of the horrible smell I just can’t bring myself in applying them to the lips. Won’t repurchase there are way better glosses out on the market. I’d rather pay a bit extra and get a nice product that smells nice as well since I’m applying these to the month area	negatif
3156	5163487	Came on my jan box. Only have the bottle had product in it. One star down. Smelled funny. Intermittently nice then it would hve a chemical smell. Two stars down. Kind of felt like it was stripping my hands of essential oils in shower. Three stars. Did nothing for my hair. My hair is still the same, ot softer or anything it advertised. There goes four stars. Don't waste time or money o this product.	negatif
3157	19650735	NOT AT ALL what i expected! I do not like this scent, The mail spice bomb smells way better.	negatif

3166	17396297	Did not like this scent at all! Gives me a headache. It is also irritating to my skin.	negatif
3167	12948552	First of all this product does nothing! I was so excited to get it because it is supposed to Moisturize AND mattify the skin(neither of which it does). It smells like chemicals covered up with bad perfume and has ALCOHOL as one of the first ingredients. On top of all of this it is super expensive for a drug store product! I do not recommend	negatif
3168	18677400	I received this fragrance complimentary in my Harvest VoxBox.it mostly just smells like alcohol. After a few minutes you can smell the pear blossom scent. It reminds me of being in an elevator with a bunch of women wearing bad perfume. I like clean natural smelling scents like Philosophy Pure Grace or Amazing Grace. I will not purchase this fragrance and I do not recommend it.	negatif

3193	5256749	scented, awful scent. This body butter is very thick and ok for dry skin, but for me the perfume was way way too much, also I felt that the strong perfume in it (the alcohol) took away from the moisturizing aspect that it was supposed to give. In the comments I saw someone said that this smelled like strong cake batter, I don't know about that, to me it smelled like a bad strong musk perfume, which will make me never buy this.	negatif
3194	1308804	It had a really bad smell! The leather didn't last for very long and I had to pump more and more just to finish rinsing myself.
