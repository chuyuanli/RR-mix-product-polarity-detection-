112	16565938	I love this scent it's so refreshing! I always get my hand soap in this scent and same with the hand sanitizer . Whenever I use this scent people compliment the smell. It's not overly strong like perfume but it does leave you smelling nice! Affordable and makes a good gift!	positif
113	16634859	This is my FAVORITE summer time scent! I love bath and body works and when they came out with this OAHU scent I bought everything! Perfume, lotion, body spray, shower gels. Anything in this scent smells amazing ma so would recommend it for sure!!	positif
114	17523626	The scent is my favorite Bath and Body works scent. I've been buying products in this scent for years. It's a perfume smell but not over powering. The lotion is moisterizing but doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy.	positif
115	17889025	This perfume smells great! It is a fresh and clean scent, and does not wear off quickly. The scent is so refreshing, and it makes me feel like I should be off on a yacht in the Mediterranean. A very luxurious, yet also wearable scent.	positif
116	17843220	This fragrance has a very clean scent which I love! I love the vanilla notes and have purchased this scent several times and every time it’s been at Sephora. The One’s scent last all day keeping you smelling fresh.	positif
117	25331385	"My . 1 of all time This is an awesome deal on my very favorite fragrance! You're essentially paying $20 for a 1oz bottle (typically $70). You can travel with the 1oz easily, keep it for yourself or gift it. I use the 1oz to refill my Mon Paris atomizer :) It's sweet (strawberry) scent without being flowery or rosy. It's sugary without smelling like brown sugar or a dessert. The citrusy notes are strong enough to cut through the sweetness of strawberry. It makes me think of fruit salad covered in whip cream with an ice cold strawberry mimosa on the side. It's not a childish scent but not a ""mature"" scent either. It's certainly youthful but the citrus helps to keep it in firmly in the sexy, grown up category. There's also no musk or rose or powder happening here. It's fresh and sweet and bright and it lasts for hours if you get an EDP. Honestly, this is my favorite perfume of all time. I've tried a million on my quest. This is my holy grail, I've finished my first bottle and I'm back to buy this gift set. It's suitable for all seasons!! It's warm and sexy enough for winter, it's bright and citrusy enough for summer. For reference as to whether we have similar tastes: I like sexy, sweet, smoky fragrances that include things like strawberries, amber, vanilla, citrus, jasmine, chocolate, smoke. I strongly dislike rose, powder, green, ""fresh"", soapy and clean or oceanic fragrances. My all time faves: YSL Mon Paris, Tom Ford Noir Pour Femme, Versace Eros, Lalique Amethyst, Replica Fireplace, Elizabeth and James Bourbon. If you like similar fragrances to these, you might like Mon Paris! If you have smelled Black Opium and its too sugary for you, you might like Mon Paris. If you sorta like Flowerbomb but it's too flowery and turns powdery on your skin, you might like Mon Paris. Hope you love it!!"	positif
118	17799118	"I was on the hunt for a simple multi use soap that would simplify my routine and leave my skin comfortable, because while I enjoy my usual multi product regimen- somedays I just ain’t got time for that.<br style=""color: rgb(0, 47, 54); font-family: &quot;Amazon Ember&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The dove pink bar far exceeds my expectations. Creamy lather, soft skin that isn’t tight feeling after. The scent is pretty, though I think it’s just broaching the side of too sweet and cloying, but happily it doesn’t cross the line. The scent itself reminds me of a clean rose water. But after rinsing I don’t smell of it, which is good for me, I don’t have to worry about it affecting any perfumes I wear or when I go without fragrances irritating anyone who is scent sensitive.<br style=""color: rgb(0, 47, 54); font-family: &quot;Amazon Ember&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">My face feels great and is completely makeup free after washing.

119	5420070	This is a beautiful fragrance that I have fallen in love with. For me this smells so good! First off I love white florals Jasmine being my favorite, second I love rose especially Bulgarian rose. I like it because it's not too sweet. I also love woody notes in perfumes. Lastly my favorite scent is musk, I look for it in a lot of the scents I wear. So when I saw this on Fragrantica I decided to try it. So I took a risk and bought the 1.6 ounce bottle and turns out that I could wear this all the time I just adore it. It's up there in price but there are discounted sites so I found mine for a reasonable price.Musky floral scents are what I like and prefer to wear. So this is a great scent for me because it checks all the boxes of what I like in a fragrance. Here are the notes per Fragranatica:Top: Orange blossom, Jasmine, Bulgarian roseMiddle: MuskBase: Coumarin, vetiver, white and black cedar, patchouli These notes to me make a perfume that I just love and I really like how most of Narciso's Rodriguez's perfumes use musk. That's what led me to this line. I also own For Her edp and like that too. But this is just love! I love how it settles into this lovely skin scent and it lasts on me for hours but the sillage is normal you'll leave a trail but it's nothing super strong or offensive for me it's a sexy flowery musk in all of its glory. If you like musk and white florals I'd say it's a safe blind buy but I do say try it before you buy it if you're paying full retail. Also I love the skin colored bottle. I love how chunky it is lol. I find it quite groovy. ;) As a musk lover I could see other musk lovers enjoying this. It's a beautiful one if you ask me. I will repurchase this. Recommended.	positif
120	22749927	I am a huge lover of perfume in general but my usual choices would be lighter, almost fruity fragrances. I was excited to try something new. My package arrived and as I opened the box I was impressed with the deep burgundy coloured packaging and bottle, although it’s simply shaped it’s very classy. My initial couple of squirts didn’t impress me, I sprayed my wrists (2 squirts) but was overpowered with the depth to the scent. It was strong! A couple of hours later it was still as strong and I was starting to get a headache, I was tempted to wash it off but resisted. I didn’t try it again for another couple of days because I was a little put off. The next time I was a little more thrifty with my squirts, I sprayed this skin underneath my shirt, just one spray and went about my day. I was aware I was wearing it and as I kept catching a waft I was liking the depth more and more. By the end of the day I could still smell a faint lingering tinge of scent. It felt like it had settled into my skin and I ‘clicked’ with the scent like a jigsaw with all the right pieces. This is what I would call a wintery fragrance - I wouldn’t wear this in the spring/summer but with scarfs, tights, boots and coats this feel right. I have worn this most days since then and it’s become less of a ‘trial’ and more of a go to favourite. This isn’t a perfume I would have tried in store or chosen for myself but it has widened my scope for my future our purchases and I would definitely buy again when my bottle runs out.

121	10819586	"I have fallen in love with this scent! I was on the hunt for something crisp and clean, since most of my perfumes are warm and musky, and this was the gold that I found. I was originally interested in Acqua di Gio by Giorgio Armani, and although that is a great scent, I thought it was kinda heavy. The Giorgio Armani scent reminded me of Marc Jacob's Honey fragrance. I was in the mood for something much lighter, so I sprayed Light Blue onto the wrist that I didnt test Acqua di Gio on. I strongly suggest wearing a perfume for a day before you decide to purchase it because the oils in perfumes sit differently on different bodies and will smell different on any person. Throughout the day, I would smell both wrists and ask for people's opinions on which they thought smelled better. Light Blue was the winner in my book based on how I liked it and also on what my friends thought. Acqua di Gio was like the older, more mature sister of Light Blue. Light Blue smelled like fresh laundry and a crisp summer day, very light and clean. Acqua di Gio was heavier and much stronger, still clean-smelling, but when I smelled the wrist it was on I couldn't take more than one whiff without being like ""Wooo!"" Both are beautiful scents, but if you're looking for a very flirtatious and free perfume, I think Light Blue is the way to go. It wore very nicely and even after a few hours, I could still smell it. Acqua di Gio you could definitely smell, like A LOT. That was too much for me. I would check them out and grab a sample at Sephora to test for yourself!"	positif
122	5412866	"I was supposed to receive (as a reviewer) the EDP but got the EDT instead. The bottle has the signature horse blanket plaid--but the EDT bottle is monochrome (think the EDP bottle is the plaid colors.) Pictured here? The EDT. In any case, it was lucky--because as an EDT it is one of those, you need to smell good but you don't want to overpower the room scents. You can spray it up, down and you won't make someone ill. I'm actually sensitive to many perfumes (itch, burn, asthma) and my test is if I can wear it. Then it's made of quality ingredients and the newer perfume additives that were invented to improve throw at the expense of good, natural essential oils aren't here to bother me. Who wrote here, that the EDT is for summer and quite different than the EDP, which is richer? Quite right--I haven't smelled the EDP yet, but the EDT is definitely VERY suitable for summer and it's my go-to summer fragrance. Here is a case where the EDT may be a great choice for a citrusy, floral, light ""cologne"" that won't get obnoxious. Supposedly, this is to open with green lemon, frosted pear and white almond. Mid notes white peony. The drydown is vanilla, amber, mahogany and Tonka bean (more vanillic.) I like woody vanilla and anyway, try to avoid it these days? Almost impossible. I love amber as well. So the base notes are among my faves. The lemon vanishes pretty quickly but the peony comes through. Peony is a soft, peppery fresh rose-ish scent (maybe a greener rose is a way to describe it.) So this scent is green, fresh, slightly fruity (pear and lemon) and green-floral. The dry down is muted; not heavy as an oriental but enough there to fix it. I haven't tried the EDP but I imagine the dry down and peony are more pronounced. (I think the white almond is the almond BLOSSOM, not the almond prussic acid scent.)"	positif
123	5093692	I purchased this *intentionally* and knew what I was getting so here is my review: This is a small cigar-sized box of three miniature bottles of the three available fragrances from Christian Louboutin. As is the case with virtually all mini perfume bottles these are NOT sprays but instead are dabbers/splash tops. That should be expected. The box and presentation is careful and detailed, though the front button on my box had fallen off when it arrived and I had to glue it back on myself, though no worries. The bottle sizes, at a collectible .16 Oz is also very standard for coffret mini sizes. If you were aware of the price of the full-size bottles of each of these fragrances then the $95 price of this miniature collection makes perfect sense. All good so far. Now for the fragrances themselves. All of the fragrances are classy and refrain from overdoing it or having any one note that completely overwhelms you. My favorite by far is the Tornade Blonde. I cannot stop smelling it. It is soft, but compelling, comfortable, and perfect. Something you could smell all day. This is my every day scent. Bikini Questa Sera is a little sweeter and more of a sunny scent - something I think a younger audience might like but it's still sophisticated. It has a beachy, tropical scent. Trouble in Heaven was my least favorite - but still no loser in the grande scheme of things. I think I will find myself wearing this when I might be spending time outdoors. It might be a good fragrance for the autumn. Overall this set is a fantastic buy. It is of course a bit pricier than other miniature perfume sets, but with this set you are getting something highly unique. This set should be set apart from even the other typical high end perfume sets. I myself am a perfume connoisseur and I knew I had to have this as soon as I saw it. If you're wanting to try the Louboutin fragrances this is also a great way to try all three (3) without spending for the full-size bottles of each. You won't be disappointed, I promise.	positif
124	19112327	"I love this perfume! It has a great floral, sweet smell without being too cloying. I would recommend it for more of a winter scent than a summer scent though. And i preferred to use it as a more ""grown-up"" scent for younger women. The bottle is so cute as well. Would definitely recommend for someone looking for a slightly more grown-up scent. I use the chanel chance eau tendre as well for a lighter scent and more casual days."	positif
125	10543750	Si is the most stunning scent I have ever had the pleasure of spritzing myself with! We all aim to have a wearable scent that is long lasting, the signature scent that passers by or friends will immediately stop you and ask 'what is that perfume you're wearing?' Well this ladies is definitely that scent! I'm always conscious with a perfume that I cannot smell it on myself but Si is that scent which lingers forever... Timeless, sultry but sweet at the same time. I save this perfume for when I really want to be indulgent.	positif
126	11996705	"I'm not one to buy perfumes all of the time but when I find a scent that I love I end up buying it sooner than later. Smelled this at my local Macy's the other day and it's a very nice scent. The scent is not a ""rose"" scent so do not let that scare you away. I love viva la juicy and this is a nice sister to it- very sweet scent but not as sweet as the original viva la juicy. Couldn't resist the cute bottle too!"	positif
127	14302155	I was looking for a new perfume scent so I naturally purchased Sephoras sampler set that had a scent certificate for the scent you liked most. I was initially drawn to the elegant and substantial bottle so I put some on and wore it to bed. The clean and sophisticated scent still lingered the next morning. I'm so glad I traded in my Sephora scent coupon for Gucci Bamboo. The bottle which would have been $72 at Sephora looks great on my shelf and smells soft enough to wear every day.	positif
128	10817014	This is my staple scent that I have used for years. EVERYONE loves this smell. Nobody has ever told me my perfume scent was odd. I usually receive compliments when I meet new people on this scent because it is that lovable! It stays on for a really long time (I would say 8-9 hours) and makes you feel very flirty. The scent is clean, feminine, but not overbearing.Love the compliments I receive when I use this! Never going to change my scent.	positif
129	5232008	Wow, this scent is amazing. Although Gardenia isn't indicated in the scent note description, I find that this perfume smells exactly like a real gardenia flower. The scent is a strong floral so you have to love sophisticated, rich florals to truly appreciate this scent. The price tag is a little expensive, but it will last all day, and you don't need more than a single spray so it should last a very long time. Love this heavenly scent!!! A+++ New fav!!!	positif
130	1092387	I am in love with this perfume! I initially received it as a sample, and decided to splurge on a 50 mL bottle after having tried it out. It’s a lovely light, floral, and feminine scent that’s perfect for everyday use, and doesn’t give me any headaches. This has definitely become my signature fragrance! It lasts about six hours on my skin, and seems to last forever on my clothes (until I wash them), which extends its staying power. My boyfriend also loves how it smells on me. The price is steep, but in my opinion, it’s worth it!	positif
131	1320595	I tried the new Dove Exfoliating Body Polish in the scent macadamia nut and rice milk. Let me just say that my expectations were very low , as normally brand name body scrubs suck. I got to give props to Dove on this one. First of all it smells so good! Like a nutty ocean flower smell. Nice and light fragrance. The scrub itself worked very well. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Besides the fact that it scrubs well, the smell alone won me over. Most scrubs smell heavy of stinky perfume, not this one. Overall I'm impressed. I will definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
132	1095441	I’m of South Indian descent and have warm yellow undertones so I opted for the regular (non tint) version to avoid looking ashy. However while the texture is smooth and application is so simple, the whitecast is very noticeable. The smell is ...horrible. I’m sensitive to fragrances products, and while this doesn’t have any strong perfume scent, the aftersmell is just weird and lingers if you go without any makeup. Also going to the gym and sweating, the white cast looks even MORE noticeable than before and so gross lol. But other than those minor issues (for me, I mean I doubt I’ll fine the love of my life at the gym) I really like this spf!	negatif
133	874501	Absorbs Quickly,Goes On Smoothly,Long Lasting,Not Greasy,Smells Great I love Philosophy Falling in Love. It has a nice soft fragrance. Great for someone that doesn't want the floral smell of Amazing Grace. I love to use the shower gel, lotion/body cream and perfume for a lasting all day scent. Only wish they sold the body cream in the stores. The lotion is great for summer but if you have really dry skin, you might want the moisturizing body butter or cream.,z:Bought the Falling in Love in the Gaylord store.

136	5419265	I was looking for an old school scent to add to my collection that would remind me of the powerhouse fragrances in the early 90's that were around when I was a young teen & first got into perfume, I had memories of the smell so took a punt on the 30ml edt as I knew it was a very strong fragrance. It arrived today through strawberry net, well this did not disappoint, 5 hours later it's going strong & developed into a lovely deep floral, it's very unique, not for a young woman but more in the 30's who is self assured & stylish. Classy fragrance.	positif
137	5407718	I purchased the travel sized spray and within a few months i had already finished it, now I normally cant finish fragrances, so you can imagine how much i love this scent. I recently was at sephora and saw the dry oil for body and hair and tried it, now I wasn't able to smell it on myself because i was already testing out a few other scents. but anyway, a light spritz for both the oil and or fragrance is more than enough. currently this is my favorite perfume, its sweet but not annoyingly sweet, perfect date night perfume. this and a gucci guilty is currently my favorite	positif
138	5946686	Fresh and fabulous!!!!! One of my favorite scents ever!!!!!! I keep getting compliments on it and my husband LOVES it!!!! I find it very sophisticated so I'm surprised at a couple reviews. I am addicted to perfume add have paid upwards of $500's for several so I know cheap scent when I smell it...and this is not a cheap smelling perfume in anyway!!!Yes it has a bit of innocence to it but it is a layered fragrance that you'll love in every stage. It's a dream from spray to dry down and has fantastic staying power!! I bought 2 so I cam make sure I have a backup!! I promise if you like juicy floral and spices scents you will ADORE this!!!!!	positif
139	5933839	I've been using a sample size for about two months and it's still working beautifully. The mascara doesn't have an irritating perfume scent. The Diorshows fragrance stung my eyes. When you smell the wand there is a slight Floral smell but it doesn't sting my eyes at all. It doesn't smudge or flake even after a workout. It does provide clumpy drama and volume but it's very pretty. If you wear glasses which I do sometimes this is the perfect mascara to make your lashes look visible and stand out behind your glasses. I would pick up a full size but probably wait until a sale because it is pricey. It can look spidery but I enjoy that look.	positif

When i first tried this i only sprayed it once on my arm in the store, later on into the night in bed i was still smelling my arm!! Needless to say i went and bought the full size from Macys, it is quite expensive (what perfume isn't to be honest) but you more than get what you pay for. Go try it ou	positif
141	7839053	This is by far my all time favorite fragrance and that is saying a lot. The staying power on this is amazing. I originally got it as a sample and tried it one day as I was trying to choose a perfume for my wedding day. The day I wore this I got so many compliments and the fact that I could smell it 8 hours after applying it was the selling point for me. It is a nice deep mature scent with some sweet notes. I felt as though it was very appropriate for my age (32) and as a day and night perfume. I will keep buying this over and over..it's that good.	positif
142	22647469	I was in the market for a perfume that I could really call my own and I'm happy I found this one. I was sick and tired of my old scent that everyone else seemed to own and discovered this one as a Sephora points gift. I loved the little roller ball so much that I bought the big bottle! I appreciate being able to test scents out in samples because sometimes a fragrance can begin to annoy me, but not this one! Not only does it smell great, but it looks so badass. I love that the perfume itself is slightly coral colored and the bottle is black sparkle - a very edgy combination for edgy girls like myself.  	positif
143	13125396	Hands down, this is one of my all time favorite perfumes!It is very strong, so a little goes a long way, but my goodness, it is phenomenal!I find it to be a sweet and slightly spicy gourmand scent, and it lasts all day long. I even fell asleep without showering one day after applying it at 8 am that morning, and I could literally smell it on myself when I got up the next morning...and I love that!!So if you use this, be prepared to smell amazing for 24+ hours. Also... be ready for a lot of compliments and questions as to what you are wearing.I am a hug fan of sweet/gourmand fragrances, so this was right up my alley. I will re purchase this over and over again!	positif
144	14228346	The opening of this perfume is definitely sweet from the top notes that are berries, just lovely,, the vinyl gives it a sharp smell. after this the fragrance changes is a lovely deeper rose smell.Like most rose fragrances it is soft and moderate, while I wish to smell it around myself during the day.I sense that people around me do smell it after a few hours since I got loads of compliments every time I gently sprayed myself from tip to toe with my favourite perfum. I love that this has musk and patchouli, but neither are 'screaming' in this fragrance. In fact, none of the notes are 'screaming' but they are all very nicely blended together for a light, soft, feminine but not girly scent.	positif

147	4835181	I absolutely love this! I initially received a free sample of the perfume in an online order, and completely fell in love with the sweet, patchouli smell. I wouldn't really consider this to be a floral scent, to me it is more sweet but not too overbearing. I have never smelt anything like it. I was ready to purchase the full size bottle of the fragrance, and then I checked the mail to see that I had received a full size bottle of this oil and a small bottle of the fragrance from Influenster. I can honestly say that I probably never would've thought to buy the oil -- but I absolutely LOVE it! It definitely makes the fragrance last longer and it makes your skin as smooth as a baby's bottom. It looks especially great on the legs too ;)	positif
148	4852637	I recieved this precious oil from Influenster to review for my honest opinion, everything I say is 100% my own person opinion of the product. I'm usually not a fan of perfume oils because honestly they either A) smell bad or B) the scent doesn't last long. But I instantly loved this, when you pair it with the FlowerBomb Fragrance spray it's even better. This lasts all day and you only need a small drop to go along way. I personally apply it to my wrist and neck which usually I would never apply anything scented to my neck because I have a very sensitive nose but this is light and doesn't burn/dry out my nose at all. I would recommend this to anyone who likes soft flowery smells.	positif
149	7823997	I was walking through Von Maur to look at dresses and stopped at the perfume counter to smell this silly fragrance that everyone was talking about and that was in a super popular song. Wow! I was so pleasantly surprised. I couldn't immediately afford it since it is a little pricey if you're on a budget but I simply couldn't get this scent off my mind. I finally bought after working a little overtime and have zero regrets. You only need one spray since it does last for a really long time on the skin so the bottle does last awhile. If you dont believe me, got to a department store and smell it for yourself. 	positif
150	10549199	"I first smelled this perfume in high school when a friend wore it on a school trip. I secretly sprayed myself with it before a night out to see a live musical theatre show. On the elevator to go downstairs to the lobby to meet with my peers a man told me ""Not to be weird or anything but what is that perfume it fills this elevator with such a beautiful fragrance I must know what it is to buy my wife it.""

151	20218791	Was super excited to get this as my anniversary gift from my other half. Smells so nice and sweet. The bottle is super cute too and the packaging is just amazing. Super girly and looks cute on my vanity table.I feel like the only thing letting it down is that the smell doesn’t seem to last long and I need to spray more on a few times throughout the day. When I first spray it everyone comments on how nice it smells and ask what perfume I’ve got on but then after a few hours the scent has faded and need a little top up. Other than that though I do love this perfume and will purchase again. Viktor & Rolf Bonbon 50ml Eau de Parfum Fragrance Gift Set	positif
152	23324541	Perfect combination of clean, sweet and sexy. Love, love love this perfume. I was afraid it would be overpoweringly sweet but it isn’t at all. It does smell very similar to Tom Ford Neroli Portofino at first but dries down warmer and bit musky. Much sexier than the description implies. I tend to switch around and combine perfumes depending on mood and occasion. I think I could wear this everyday and it’s definitely my new go to fragrance. If I designed my own scent this would be it. At this price I’ll be stocking up while it’s available. Urban Decay please don’t take this away.	positif
153	4804191	clean like soap/laundry. Love this fragrance, it did take a while to appreciate the scent as it smells a lot like regular cleansing soap except not soap, it is perfumey but kinda soapy smell to it, clean i guess. I love to wear it to work,I'm a nurse so not really suppose to wear perfume to work but when i wear this no one says anything ha ha, i think its because it just smells clean like soap. It does evoke a memory of earlier days/smells too. I bought the rollerball in case i did not like it so as not to spend too much and i am almost out of it. I will repurchase. I recently smelled the Lazy Sunday morning at a Sephora shop and i love it too, am going to purchase it soon.	positif
154	4792461	good value, unique and wonderous. This fragrance is amazing! I am a huge fan of Peru Balsam as it is, and to smell it in this perfume almost makes me weak with delight. The wood smoke is balanced with a bit of sweetness to give a warm, cozy, rather evocative fragrance experience. It's wonderful. That being said I would say less is more with this fragrance. It packs a punch, and I this dousing in it; however tempting, would really take away from what this scent can deliver as it evolves on the skin. I really hope this is released in a roller ball form. But worse come to worse I can make my own roller ball out of it. If you like warm, smokey, or gourmand scents give this one a sniff. It won't disappoint.	positif
155	11247958	On my 31st birthday, my Aunt Carrie gave me this perfume. I didn't think much of the pink mesh packaging and I expected a gentle fragrance that Aunts give their nieces as they become old. I was wrong. I still can't get over how wonderful it smells, and that it has serious aromatherapy properties. Unfortunately, I also experienced an immediate confidence boost that made me want to behave badly! This scent has this effect, because you feel too sexy for anything else in your life. La vie est belle, I'm too sexy for my own review!	positif
156	18244170	I honestly completely loved it !!<br />I really have nothing bad to say about it. <br />The fragrances are varied: Poème and Trésor in Love are more of a lighter scent whereas Hypnose and Trésor are a bit more heavy, And Miracle is actually in the middle. But they all smell amazing, I promise. <br />It can seem a bit expensive, but it is Lancôme so you pay the brand also, but trust me this worths the money. You have 5 different perfumes, for each day, each mood, etc.. And even though they are small, if you use it decently and wisely it can last pretty long. And the advantage of this small size is that you just can bring everywhere !	positif
157	17923441	This is a lovely sophisticated perfume. I think it's beautiful! And is very versatile, can be used on older woman, as well as someone in their 20s. It's fragrance notes are apricot blossom and rose; its heart as lilac, iris, and peach; and its base as amber, sandalwood, musk, and vanilla. I really smell the base notes more than anything else. Maybe some peach/apricot too. It's pretty pricey, I think I spent like 70$ on it. Which actually isn't bad for a high end perfume. I am really sensitive to most, and this, if I use it lightly, doesn't seem to give me a headache. Definitely something I save for special occasions, but totally could be a signature every day scent.	positif
158	6272407	An absolutely gorgeous perfume loved by my Mum!! This Estee Lauder Perfume is very hard to find anywhere,& I'm not sure if Estee Lauder has discontinued it or made it one of their elusive fragrances!! This is a spin off from the original EsteeLauder Private Collection which Mrs E Lauder wore herself & then allowed Grace Kelly to wear!! As it states this perfume as TuberRose & Gardina in it making it a gorgeous heady floral kinda scent!! It really does last & can still actual smell it the next day of my Mum!! Anyone who adores the original Private Collection should deffo give this one a try!! Thankyou Amazon & Seller for stocking this Truely Gorgeous exceptional perfume!! Deffo 10/10	positif
159	4963030	So I recently sprayed all of the poison perfumes in store because I know they have been around forever and was always curious to how they smelled. The other two scents were awful! However, this Pure Poison fragrance was divine. A nice floral. Smelled like a white floral bouquet maybe a gardenia note is what I was picking up on. I loved it! I could see myself wearing it. I know someone wrote it was matronly. To me, I didn't get that. I'm 28 and I would wear it without fear that it was an old lady scent haha but everyone is different. I suggest smelling for yourself to make that determination :)	positif
160	13034975	My Signature Fragrance! I absolutely love this perfume. I went into my local Belk's department mall to make sure that it was the same one that I fell in love with and then bought it from Sephora. I purchased the 3.4 oz with the Miss Dior Moisturizing Body Milk on Dior website and I also purchased it cheaper than what it was priced at the mall. The two used together compliments each other so beautifully. Absolutely gorgeous smelling! This scent will stay with you all day and into the night. It is a feminine and sexy with the most beautifully soft top notes. I will definitely buy this again. 	positif
161	20326189	I wear a lot of perfumes, I have an embarrassingly large collection, and out of all of my fragrances this is the perfume that receives the most compliments. From both people I know and complete strangers. People always seem to enjoy this scent and that's no surprise. It is such a beautiful gourmand. Vanilla, musk, almond. The almond and vanilla really come out to play on my skin. I've had quite a few people tell me I smell like cherry bakewell cakes! It's rich, sweet, sticky... incredibly long lasting. What more could you want?!	positif
162	12175571	Oh dear goodness, I still remember the first time I first smelled this and it was over 15years ago! I don't claims to know the notes of this perfume but what I do know is that this is my signature scent. I don't care what season we are in, I feel that I can use this anytime because I absolutely love it. It lasts on your skin and lasts even linfer on your clothes. The bottle is a dark midnight blue color, which I like because I know light can weaken a fragrance. The juice is a pinky color. I hope this is never discontinued!	positif
163	19853373	I don't own this perfume yet but I have tried it on a gazillion times before in form of samples.. This is my mosstt favorite perfume! It has flowery note when sprayed on, something like mild jasmine and it dries down to a very mild musky scent which will be a mixture of the base note and your skin smell. Hence it will smell different on different people. But you can't not like the fragrance.. It's absolute hit! I will buy it when I have a $100 to spare on this gorgeous bottle!P.S : Make sure you buy the Eau de parfum to get the most of the fragrance.	positif
164	6191513	I love this scent. Every time I smell it it reminds me of when I was little and I would watch my mom do her makeup and hair etc and play with whatever she had out on the counter, and this used to be her go-to perfume, so she always had some around. I received a sample which prompted me to go buy this, and I also showed my mom since she's been using Beach Walk now, and she said it reminded her of when I was little and would always play with her stuff while she got ready lol. Such a cute fragrance. Very crisp and sunny.	positif
165	1791083	In my teenage years up to my 30's, I suffered from migraine headaches. Strong perfumes (most fragrances) would trigger a headache immediately- I only needed someone to walk pass me and I'd be incapacitated for 24hrs. I stopped wearing any fragrances until a lady at the Clarins counter suggested this fragrance. I have never looked back. It is refreshing, youthful, classy and demure in its scent..subtle but distinctly punchy with its essential oils. You know when someone walks past you that they are wearing Eau Dynamisante because it has the most unique smell. I also love the fact that friends always comment at how lovely I smell and ask for another hug!	positif
166	5412891	"To me this is what a grown up woman should smell like. I would describe it is a spicy floral; a ""serious fragrance."" Ergo, it is a scent that could not be mistaken for anything but expensive perfume, as opposed to, say, the remnant of the smell of your face powder or shampoo. It can be ""in your face"", which suits me well because I have a rather strong personality. Please note: I'm referring to ""plain"" Coco in this review not Coco ""Mademoiselle"" or any other olefactory sequels, so to speak. Coco. There is no substitute."	positif
167	4895110	This perfume reminds me of what women wore when I was a little girl, but though it is nostalgic for me, I think it has aged well so that someone who did not share those scent memories would still enjoy this perfume. This is not a fragrance for girls who want to smell like cotton candy, and for me it is not a casual fragrance. I wear this to performances or dining out at fine restaurants. Like many other Chanel fragrances, it is quite strong at first spray, but after a few minutes as the fragrance has time to settle it becomes very beautiful, elegant and timeless.	positif
168	7818601	"This perfume has been by go to for the past 10 years! You will never catch me wearing another fragrance. I love this because the scent is unique, but not overbearing. It says "" I'm a woman"" without saying "" I'm your grandma"". Hopefully that makes sense! Haha :)This perfume lasts ALL DAY, and I can't go one day without receiving compliments on how great it smells or having someone ask me what I'm wearing! I've been using it for so long that I don't notice the smell anymore, but it lasts all day! It can get a little pricey, but a little goes a long way. It's worth it!"	positif
169	19808847	I came across this fragrance about two years ago when a friend from work introduced this to me . One day I was like omg ! What perfume do you have on ?! When she told me it was this Chanel I had to go buy it . It's a little more than I'd normally spend on perfume but let me tell you it's so worth it !!! You only need a few sprays in the morning and it lasts all day . It's such a light and clean and fresh smell I can't really explain it . I think it would be great for any woman to wear . It's deff a classy yet simple scent .	positif
170	17078120	I was in Sephora shopping around for a new fragrance. The bottle caught my eye and I decided to spray it on. I am the kind of person who knows fragrances change, so I like to walk around the mall for a little bit so I can experience the whole fragrance. I walked away after spraying one spray on myself and in the hour that I walked around I received so many compliments it was a no-brainer that I had to buy this perfume. I love the way it looks on my vanity and the smell is incredible. it lasts a long time. Very fresh, summery scent. Perfect for spring and summer.	positif
171	23522422	Where do I begin. Well this is the first actual “designer” perfume I’ve owned (and I bought it for myself which makes it that much more special), and I couldn’t be happier I chose this fragrance. Although it is expensive, it is 100% worth it. It is a fruity yet floral scent that is super feminine, modern, and it even smells expensive. It’s long lasting, which I love, and a little goes a long way. Will probably be a regular user of this perfume for quite sometime. I absolutely recommend checking it out!	positif
172	18149241	This is my signature fragrance. First of all, I'm a huge Chanel fan and this fragrance is absolute perfection. I cannot describe how amazing this smell is. It's so fresh, summery, feminine, and luxurious. Perfect for a young lady. It opens up with a lovely citrus note that fades into a warm, floral and very clean scent. You can really smell the white flowers at the heart of this fragrance. When I wear this, I ALWAYS have a good day. It's my lucky charm! I will get married in this perfume and will wear it for the rest of my life. This is the best perfume ever!	positif
173	18577993	I'm very sensitive to scents and never wear perfume, but this is a perfume I love and genuinely look forward to wearing. It's not an immature vanilla scent, nor sickeningly sweet, it's just vanilla and creamy enough to feel comforting but just spicy enough not to make you feel bland or childish, and a touch of floral peeking out to make it smell like perfume and not like the remnants of an afternoon spent baking. It's also not weak, it's long-lasting enough for me to smell it on my sheets and on sweaters or jackets I wore while wearing it, but not intrusive either to the point where if you walk in a room it announces your arrival for you. Beautiful fragrance, very different from some of Atelier Cologne's other offerings.	positif
174	15144700	I love the Atelier line. I think that their fragrances are some of the more clear and crisp scents out on the market. I have a hard time finding ANY perfume that lasts longer than 2 hours on my skin, so the longevity of this product on my skin is about the same as others. The perfumes are quite expensive so I like to buy their sample sizes. I purchased all of their scents in sample size for $35 and it was a great way to figure out which scents lasted and smelled best on my skin. My skin is always cool so heavier scents last a bit longer. Since this is fruit based I only got to enjoy the light, citrusy scent for a couple of hours.	positif
175	5404998	"I love this pink grapefruit mist, it smells authentic, like fresh pink grapefruit. It doesn't have any other notes, thankfully, but since citrus notes tend to fade fast, you do need to reapply often. Good if you like light scents and single note fragrances. The scent is just so fresh and lovely, and there's no ""perfumey"" or alcohol stench at all. I've tested the EDT as well, and don't think it lasts any longer than this mist, so this is a better value. Regular price is $13 for a 3.3 ounce glass bottle, but they frequently have sales so you can get good deals. Love this!"	positif
176	9071405	I've always used classic Nivea creme as a moisturizer - This body wash smells EXACTLY like classic Nivea and works great - it doesn't leave me dry or greasy, and the scent is slight and pleasant instead of heavy and artificial. I'm particular about body washes, especially moisturizing body washes. Both Olay and Dove have left weird films on my skin, and most non-moisturizing washes leave my skin tight, dry, and itchy. I'm also very sensitive to fragrance, which eliminates many body washes for me since so many are heavily perfumed.	positif
177	16813491	This body wash smells divine. It has that rich, earthy, perfume-y, slightly orange-y scent that I associate with products containing argan oil, although I've never smelled pure argan oil to know whether the correlation is true. It smells like a million dollars, and that's what made me put it in my cart despite MUA's generally unfavorable reviews of Organix products. The formula is rich and creamy and, yes, somewhat moisturizing, although it still gets the post workout stank out with no problem. This stuff is so fragrant that it might be too much for some, so definitely sniff before buying and avoid if your skin is sensitive to fragrance. It would make a brilliant hand soap, as well. I see myself coming back to it, especially in winter.	positif
178	17637462	I'm an Olay girl but I got a sample of this in my WalMart Beauty Box and had to give it a try. It smells good but, although I'm sensitive to strong and musky scents, I actually felt like the scent wasn't strong enough. Perhaps that's a good thing for women who wear perfume and don't want their body wash getting in the way of it, but I don't use fragrances on my body so it's not a plus for me. However, it did leave me feeling clean and fresh. Am I going to switch from Olay to Dove any time soon? No, but if Olay is out of stock at the store or Dove goes on sale then I wouldn't be opposed to buying it!	positif
179	19199888	First impression of this product was that it looks like something I would pick up from my Salon. Not only does it look like Salon quality, but it feels that way also. It lathers so well that you really only need a small drop (for medium length hair). I enjoyed that it had a light fragrance, not an overwhelmingly perfumed smell like some shampoos. It's a very clean/natural scent. I noticed an immediate difference in my hair the next day. It was incredibly shiny and felt clean. I was highly impressed by this shampoo. Salon quality product in a comfortable price point! I received this product to test for free, but these thoughts are all my own.	positif
180	5829339	evocotive, alluring. Such a lovely, feminine gorgeous scent! If only I could find words to describe this fragrance. Let me share this, then: Every time I wear this, whether I'm at the grocery store or at a fancy function, people approach me to ask what perfume I'm wearing. Men say, you smell wonderful!!; women say, what's the name of that perfume, I have to buy it!. At the mall last week, a little girl, perhaps 5 years old, said, you smell so pretty. I have never received compliments over a fragrance like this in all my 67 years on the planet. I'll be buying this from now on!	positif
181	15228809	This product is absolutely amazing, I've had a couple of perfumes from this brand that I really liked, but this one takes the Favorite Spot! Such a fresh fragrance, balances perfectly the little hints of vanilla and raspberry with some floral scent, last literally all day long, without needing to reapply and without being too strong (I can't handle too strong perfumes, gives me headaches), which allows you to feel confident wearing it, you just know you're going to smell awesome all day long! I received this product for testing purposes as a complimentary gift from Influenster and Armani Beauty.	positif
182	17079673	Sweetness pour down your neck... ugh so satisfied! It lasts in my clothes forever and in my neck until I take a shower. The first time I got it I wasn’t expecting it to smell like that, I was SHOOK because I get dizzy when I buy strong perfumes. The scent is amazing it’s kinda like those flavors of the body shop and in the same time stronger and in a luxury beautiful bottle! My favorite perfume is flower bomb but sadly I ran out of it. I used to spray it al around my body!! The school hallways smelled like flower-bomb, students recognized my strong fragrance. And I’ll more more than happy to buy it again and this time I’ll only spray it on my neck.??	positif
183	23346244	"This is a great way to try some amazing scents without committing to that full-size price. Each of these is unique and stunning in their own ways. Beach Walk smells just like the beach does: warm, salty breeze with a tiny hint of sunscreen. Lazy Sunday Morning is a fresh, clean scent. I love it for spring. Jazz Club is my absolute favorite perfume in the world. I'm buying the full-size bottle ASAP. It's listed as a ""male fragrance"" - it's warm with tobacco, no sharp musky notes. It's a smooth cologne."	positif
184	4981078	long-lasting, innovative, great for layering, customizes my fragrances. I am a HUGE fan of lazy sunday morning, and this Blur oil is essentially a wonderfully softened version of lazy sunday. I use it by itself when I am not in the mood to really put on a fragrance, and I have actually started using this oil more and more as the base before I put Lazy Sunday on. Oil-base perfumes definitely help lock in the scent long-term, which is great for me (since the collection is eau de toilette so a bit lighter). I'm going to try Glow next, and can't wait to smell it!!	positif
185	5180255	I am a huge fan of perfumes and fragrances. I own hundreds of scents (I know it's bad) but this is hands down my favorite. I tend to gravitate towards very fresh and floral scents and this one is so fresh. It just smells so amazing! If you like fresh scents with a hint of musk that is still very girly, you will love this fragrance! Only thing I don't like is that you have to purchase a large bottle in this particular scent which is $125. If I didn't already own so much perfume I would definitely invest in this, but for not it's just too far out of my range):	positif
186	4957049	good value, long lasting, spicy sweet. I bought the full size for my husband but I wear it more than he does haha. It is very long lasting, you will smell it on yourself even after 16 hours..! And it does not morph into an unpleasant medley after 8+ hours like some other perfumes do. It is a spicy yet sweet scent and smells great on men & Women. I consider this a Unisex fragrance. The product is super effective so you only need a little spray on yourself per use, it is going to last a long time so I consider this a great Value as well. Other perfumes I usually need 3 ish spritzes but this one, just 1 moderate spritz or 2 mini spritzes are good.10/10 would buy again!!	positif
187	5212914	I'm a girl who tends to prefer the more masculine side of unisex fragrances. I find that most women's perfumes are too old lady and give me headaches/nausea because they're so syrupy/floral. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE Dylan Blue. I use one spritz and it starts of pretty manly but gradually warms up to a nice soft but sexy scent. It's not too strong but it definitely doesn't lose it's presence. It's bright and citrusy but also peppery and spicy. I just can't stop smelling myself when I wear it.	positif
188	1820495	This has become my new everyday fragrance! I'm not too keen on the spray mechanism on the bottle because it doesn't spray very evenly but aside from that, I'm very happy with it! It is quite sweet, I can smell the mandarin and cinnamon apple but the patchouli stops it being too sweet. The scent lasts a long time and I've had lots of people asking me what my perfume is when I've worn it, so that's praise in itself! The bottle looks like its going to last a really long time, so although its not cheap it is good value for money. Would definitely recommend!	positif
189	19614725	Wow, this is my new favorite fragrance!!! This is limited edition too; I am so glad I came across this and ordered a full bottle. It is a pretty and feminine scent without smelling overly gourmand (despite the name!) or sweet. However, it is a sweet perfume- just not sweet like cotton candy I guess....I can't think of anything else it smells like, and I cant stop smelling my wrists when I wear this! I think what I smell most in the listed notes for this one would be pear, coconut, and sandalwood. Highly recommend giving this one a try before it can't be found. And the bottle...so unique and beautiful!	positif
190	5227217	I've never worn any of the juicy couture fragrances but the description of this one intrigued me. I kind of disagree with it being a warm floral that sounds old ladyish to me and even though I'm in my thirties I steer far from mature scents. Ive never really liked any perfumes at the department stores, I've only ever worn pink sugar and Prada candy. This one has a sweetness but in a slightly fruity way not floral. The dry down is where the sugary scent comes through but very light and airy . Doesn't last at all though I swear I spray myself ten times a day and can't smell after an hour . Maybe it's just me but still a lovely fragrance.	positif
191	18839614	This perfume smells amazing but I can't smell it for a long time, especially if applied too heavily. I find it is very young fresh and very fruity. I think this is a nice scent but not something I would consider buying. Everyone’s nose is different.I recieved three free samples from influenster and every time I use it, i’m not that impressed. It's nice I do like it, but I feel it is similar to a few other fragrances, it is not unique.It has nice longevity, on me, could smell it on my scarf the next day.	positif
192	11084781	Words cannot describe my love for this fragrance. I picked it up at Nordstrom after hearing a blogger talk about it, and it was worth every single penny. This fragrance is very light and you never have to worry about overdoing it. Great for people who are sensitive to a lot of perfumes but still want to smell great. You can also layer it with their other fragrances to create your own signature scent.The only con to this product is that it wears away throughout the day. I wish they made this in a perfume instead of a cologne because I personally love to wear it by itself instead of layering it.	positif
193	5089878	good value, travel-friendly, intoxicating, luscious. I first bought this perfume in high school - it was my first 'big girl' perfume and I was obsessed. I could not stop smelling myself or the bottle. After years of switching between myriad scents, I came back to this one and may have bought 2 bottles because I love it that much. Though an EDT, the scent has such staying power and is very unique. The only thing I find a bit similar is Bottega Veneta's Perfume (both are from Michel Almairac, though composed of very different notes). This fragrance has a surprisingly juicy note despite being composed of florals and spice, and borders a bit on the masculine. It's really delicious and the distinct plastic box bottle is pretty unique. It's really a beautiful fragrance.	positif
194	4756416	travel-friendly, reusable, will last a long time. Used reward points for the sample like the other VIB Rouge Review after I smelled the tester! It's amazing, feminine, but musky. Also potent, in a good way, you don't need much to get a scent like you do with other scents, it will last a long time. You can smell the goodness but not in I don't like too feminine floral perfumes, my style is rocker chic, lots of cute bling and pyramid studs (contemporary moto), so I loved this fragrance, will be buying the full sized when I finish the tester. I used the Ed Hardy Villian before and actually finished that whole bottle.	positif
195	5029102	I love this perfume. It is a nice light, floral fragrance that doesn't overpower you or make you smell like soap. I tend to like spicy fragrances, but this one caught my attention when I was looking for a special scent for my wedding day. The assistant at Sephora made me a sample so I could try it and make sure it wore well on me and didn't cause a reaction with my sensitive skin. Luckily, I was in the clear and it was the perfect accoutrement on my wedding day. I purchased the full size eau de parfum and now have it in my rotation of scents for special occasions, though I do sometimes wear it for everyday purposes as well depending on my mood.	positif
196	23017651	Amazing fragrance! I fell in love with this perfume from the very first moment. It's a light floral scent leaving a feeling of freshness. I've used many different types of perfumes, but this one is definitely my best choice, especially for the long summer days. It's very elegant and femimine so it's perfect for a date night too. The smell is soft and tender and it lasts long. I receive many compliments wearing this perfume. And not only it smells divine, but it comes in a very chic bottle as well. Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again and again. Absolutely worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
197	10816984	"In my top 10 faves for sure. It has a very light smell and by that I mean a nice airy, clean smell. It can be subtle or you can go to town and it can be heavy BUT because of the fragrance I think if you poured it on it wouldn't be too much lol it's a beautifully light scent. It's not overly floral, definitely not musky but more of a ""clean"" smell. It lasts pretty well, not the most long lasting I've ever used but it doesn't disappoint me with how long it does lasts either. The priced about what I would say is average for a named brand perfume/cologne and it differs based on size obviously."	positif
198	22802376	I used to wear the same  Bath Body Works Bath and Body Works Fine Fragrance Mist, Black Raspberry Vanilla, 8.0 Fl Oz all throughout middle school and high school. It found its way into my suitcase when I was packing for college. It followed me to freshman year, but that was when I knew I had to find a new scent, less fruity and more mature. I received a free sample of this during my hunt for a new perfume and this did not disappoint. It smells fresh and subtly sweet on me. It lasts all day as well, so I alternate between this and  Chloé Eau de Parfum . Go into a Sephora or any stores and test it on yourself for the day- see how it reacts to your body chemistry!	positif
199	5422816	I LOVE this perfume! Normally when I smell Burberry perfumes, I tend to not like them. This, however, smells amazing. On the Burberry website it says the notes: floral-fresh scent with gentle top notes of rose and honeysuckle,Deep heart notes of tiare flower, jasmine and peony and a hint of fresh clementine zest, Solar notes of sandalwood, musk and patchouli add a subtle warmth to create an inspiring fragrance.I love floral scents which makes sense why I would like this. The perfume is covered with a fabric with the Burberry check, super cute. Smell lasts a long time which I like.	positif
200	18514458	There's just something about this fragrance that I can't get enough of. When I put it on I constantly find myself bringing my wrist up to sniff during the day. The scent reminds me of a bubble bath I had when I was a kid, but in a good way. It's very clean, soapy, and floral smelling. It is definitely more subtle than probably any of my other perfumes, but sometimes that's all you need. I tend to use this on my off days, when just running errands with minimal makeup on. It is simple, feminine, and timeless.	positif
201	4876128	I'm a fan of Aqua Di Parma Perfumes. They are very high quality and smell amazing. I have Rosa Nobile which I find very easy to wear and even if you spray too much it doesn't have a strong scent like you put too much. Magnolia is a bit stronger so you don't need a lot. Stays on for good 8-10 hrs. I use it for every day and get many compliments. It's a very addicting smell... I highly recommend this fragrance. For those who want something citrusy and light, check out their Blu Mediterraneo line (I think it's unisex).	positif
202	4781132	good value. I received a sample of this and was hooked from the first spritz! To me, this perfume embodies summer: it reminds me of a carefree, sunny day driving with the windows down. This is def a scent for warm, casual days. To me it smells like a mix of flowers, coconut, fresh cut grass, and the streets after it just rained (if that makes sense). I'm not really good as descrbing fragrances but you should def try this...you won't be disappointed. I will be buying a few bottles so i can wear everyday this summer without running out.	positif
203	10793658	Love this fragrance! I also have the body lotion. I wanted a purse perfume and was happy to see the Fresh Cream in a roller ball. It's small, but has ample product. Perfect for your purse. The only negative (which really isn't one for me) is when you first put it on, it smells a little like alcohol. Once it dries though, it only smells like the Fresh Cream scent. My *assumption* is that it is part of the ingredients, but as alcohol evaporates quickly, it doesn't change the fragrance. Will purchase again! And again.. and again	positif
204	20342309	This product is an absolute game changer! I love trying different scents and fragrance but this product has stolen my heart. You only need one squirt on your wrist and rub your wrists together and you will have a long lasting all day fragrance. This is my favorite fragrance on the market! However, if you or a significant other get headaches with a strong smelling perfume this product is not for you. Otherwise, it is a total charm! This product is very pricey at stores such as Ulta so I would look for sales if this is a product you are interested in trying I would also recommend the 2oz purchase first since this is a hit or miss scent. Enjoy!	positif
205	17273887	When you think of Philosophy, you think of great skincare with some nice words of inspiration, like Miracle in a Jar, etc.  But have you tried their fragrances?  I am not an expert on perfumes, but this is light, floral, and it blends(?) in to the point where it doesn't seem like you're wearing perfume, you just smell good overall.  I really like using it during the day, especially at work, where a more subtle scent is a necessity.  I've tried three of these, and they are all great.  Start out by just getting a rollerball to see which one you like the most.  For me, this was the best of them.	positif
206	5936678	I really wanted to love this perfume as I owned the previous Saint. While I don't remember to the note what Saint smelled like, the nose doesn't forget a fragrance once beloved. This is a far cry from the original Saint. That being said, it isn't an unpleasant smell, not in the slightest. My review is of the tangible product I bought. Saint 2.0 smells of fresh, pure florals....almost like the birth of spring. That being said, this is definitely not worth the price I paid. Alas, I'm returning this scent.	positif
207	6089579	I actually ended up really liking this perfume. I never got to try the original incarnation, so I'm reviewing this from that standpoint. Usually I'm not a huge fan of florals, but because this mixes a floral base with a bunch of other notes that appear as the fragrance wears, it ended up being my preference between the two launches (Saint & Sinner). A few other people have said that it doesn't wear for very long, but I found that I could still smell it on my skin about 7 hours after initial application. I really enjoyed how the scent evolved over the wear period, and didn't find any of the notes unpleasant. I would not consider this an overwhelmingly strong fragrance by any means. I received both Saint and Sinner complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review.	positif
208	6090175	travel-friendly. Wow! I didn't know what to expect when I received this scent from Influenster. Kat Von D is my favorite beauty brand and I think of trend setter when I think of her. I wasn't sure what to expect. Saint is my favorite of the Saint/Sinner combo and it is super unique. I usually gravitate towards sweeter fragrances and this one has the vanilla, sandalwood and caramel with a floral twist! It's very unique but smells divine and lasts ALLLL day! This perfume is a winner! a little goes a very long way and it smells just wonderful! Feminine and sweet!	positif
209	6179938	I received a sample of this fragrance complimentary from Influenster. I was excited to try because I've heard the KatVonD perfumes have such a clamour to bring them back. I've tried Saint first, I love Jasmine and vanilla notes on my perfume and when I read up that Saint has it was eager to try it! I like the smell of it, does start very light and fresh but then it stays on for a time, it starts to fade into a musky vanilla scent for me which I like. I'm taking off one star just because the longevity is not there for me, doesn't last very long on me, I'd say only a good 2 hours and it fades.	positif
210	6183558	lovely, subtle. I’m really not much of a fragrance girl if I’m being completely. I definitely Don’t like anything too strong. Like, there is nothing worse when you can smell someone before you can see them. But that is EXACTLY why I loved this perfume! It’s subtle but oh so lovely. It’s the kind of scent that you smell on yourself occasionally throughout the day and one that someone compliments when you hug them. But you don’t feel like you’e stuck in a floral cloud that smells like your grandma. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for something light, airy with warm undertones. Love it!	positif
211	6184158	This is such a beautiful scent! The jasmine, vanilla and musk blend so wonderfully together. I wasn't expecting much from this fragrance, just your run of the mill fragrance but this blows my other perfumes right out of the water. On me, it smells just like jasmine flowers and then as it dries down and I get the vanilla and musk. It's just so amazing, I love it!! Sinner is great too but this one takes the Cake for me. Oh and it lasts a long time too! I received this complimentary via influenster for my honest review.	positif
212	6077124	This perfume makes me feel exactly as my title describes- a sexy sinner. As if I'm a female Christian Grey!This perfume is sultry and sophisticated. I don't feel like I'm a teenager wearing a fruity spritz, I feel like a woman hunting for prey! Eat your hearts out, people... This fragrance will make you irresistible. It smells like dark flowers and musky oil. I love that the scent lingers all day... You can be a saint in the morning, and a sinner at night. So much love for Kat & this line. I received this free in exchange for an unbiased review.	positif
213	18075488	I work with perfume as part of my job, so I come across a lot of good-smelling fragrances pretty frequently. What this means is that it is difficult for one to catch my nose. I received a sample in my Sephora Play Box and tried Saint on my inner elbow just so that I could smell it, not thinking much of it. Holy cow. This perfume. I LOVE it. It has a strong vanilla scent, so stay away if that's not your cup of tea. I love vanilla, but not cupcake vanilla, like a grown and sexy vanilla. This perfume absolutely delivers. The longevity has been impressive as well - just two sprays on my inner elbow and I have been able to smell it all day long.	positif
214	4758765	I recently had to get rid of all my perfume, scented body products, candles, soap etc. because artificial/synthetic fragrances have started to trigger my migraines. I thought I would never be able to wear anything fragranced again until a friend recommended this line to me. The perfumes are scented with natural and essential oils instead of chemicals. This stuff is so amazing! The scent is intoxicating, a sexy, rich, deep vanilla. Sweet without smelling like a cookie. Most importantly, this doesn't give me migraines! I love this brand and I love this product. I plan on buying this in all the other scents they offer.	positif
215	6175445	As someone fairly new to fragrance and not a fan of extreme smells the Lavanilla brand is a god-send!!! Not only are they cruelty free but also create beautiful products. I bought this as a first perfume and can't stop using it. Works great on its own and plays well with other scents due to it being so simple! I've had mine for over a year in the roller ball and still have plenty left, and still smells like the day I got it! 10/10 if you're looking for a simple and sweet scent!	positif
216	6059786	This smells like all my favorite perfumes from the 80's and 90's. There's a Vanderbilt, Obsession, Navy, Vanilla Musk quality to it. I can't explain it but if you have smelled all those perfumes, you will definitely understand what I am talking about once you smell this! I have been looking for something that didn't have that Juicy Couture/Bath And Body Works smell for a while! That terrible fruity pink scent that has taken hold of the fragrance industry for the last 5 or so years. This is ultra feminine! It doesn't have a lot of staying power tho. But this is a very close second favorite, the first being Tocca Florence.	positif
217	18923673	Candy by Prada smells like the thing I want to bake and eat the whole pan of. A co-worker of mine introduced me to this perfume and I am so glad she did. This is one of my absolute FAVORITE fragrances. The bottle is very sturdy (I have dropped it and it did not break) and it sprays very nicely! The product is dispersed perfectly and the perfect amount comes out! This is a very sweet-smelling fragrance, so if you like to smell like baked goods, you found the scent. I cannot recommend Candy by Prada enough! 	positif
218	19641802	Sweetly Warm and Happy :-) Each perfume smells different on each of us due to body chemistry, and this one is 'my' fragrance. I've always loved warm fragrances, but gourmands are new for me and have always been a bit too sweet. The Romantic scent from this line though - on me it dries down to what I can only describe as 'sweetly warm'. I don't know what it is about it, but it makes me so happy that I am going 'all in' and buying a bottle. Go to Sephora and try it on for yourself if you can't find a sample. I hope it makes you as ridiculously happy as it makes me. If not, I hope you find something that does.	positif
219	4647564	I've been purchasing the rollerball for a long time now and I just couldn't get myself to purchase a large bottle because of the steep price. I needed at least a $150 purchase to keep my current status and thought this might be a perfect opportunity. I love this fragrance so much!!!! I mainly use it for special occasions and have a different perfume for everyday and I get compliments every time I wear this. I can understand why ppl say it has kind of a grandma smell to it but for me I don't smell it at all. My boyfriend loves this scent on me as well so double winner!!!!	positif
220	19633648	Amazing Light Floral Fragrance I am in love with this perfume! I initially received it as a sample, and decided to splurge on a 50 mL bottle after having tried it out. It’s a lovely light, floral, and feminine scent that’s perfect for everyday use, and doesn’t give me any headaches. This has definitely become my signature fragrance! It lasts about six hours on my skin, and seems to last forever on my clothes (until I wash them), which extends its staying power. My boyfriend also loves how it smells on me. The price is steep, but in my opinion, it’s worth it!	positif
221	5392662	I received the travel size as a gift, and I absolutely love this perfume. I'm not much of a white florals person, but I love how these florals mix with the same original base as the original Chloe EDP. The initial spray smells like an abundance of white florals to me. But the drydown is a clean, powdery floral. I had traces of this lovely scent on my jacket, and kept wondering what it was until I realized that it was my perfume. I haven't tried their other fragrances aside from the original and Roses de Chloe, but this one is by far my favorite of the 3. Hope this doesn't get discontinued!!	positif
222	10546694	I received this as a present from my other half. I was sceptical at first as I usually like quite strong, powerful smells such as 212 Sexy or PR Olympia. However, this perfume has shocked me! It smells Devine and I've never had so many compliments all throughout the day! Only thing I would say is I like to spray at least 5 times per use and it doesn't seem to last as long (I'm already almost out since March) I would recommend if you're looking for a classic scent that will always get noticed. Such a stunning feminine fragrance. Most retailers have this on offer too so can always grab a bargain	positif
223	24962883	When I first opened the box and saw the gorgeous handbag design I thought it looked and felt high quality and the sort of gift I would love to receive. You have to lower the little handbag handle to take the lid of which I though was a little quirky. Looks perfect on my perfume display! I love fresh scents so had to try this straight away. The smell of floral and very fresh was gorgeous from the first spray and is just my cup of tea and would where this regularly. The scent lasts all day and I received many compliments every time I wore the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
224	18580310	These kits are the PERFECT gift. My mom and I are both picky when it comes to fragrance, so I bought her a kit last year and she loved it! She got to take her time trying each fragrance and testing how the smell worked and lasted on her skin and then got to pick a full size for herself. So really it was kind of like two gifts in one. Now she has specifically requested this kit for Christmas again this year! There are a few repeats, because they are popular scents, but it’s a really solid mix of scent families and profiles. I think anyone could find at least one perfume in this kit that they love.	positif
225	10537839	This is a very sexy and seductive floral scent that is long lasting. This is a parfum which is one step down from pure fragrance so the fact that it is long lasting and you only need a little to go a long way and last the day is to be expected. The bottle is adorable and would look perfect on any vanity table. The amount you need to use daily gives this perfume the price of very cheap perfumes since it lasts so long because you use so little. If you're looking for a sweet, feminine, floral smell thats still has a sexy and seductive side just like you this is going to be the perfume for you.	positif
226	10557931	As a perfume junkie and fanatic I just have to say YOU MUST OWN THIS IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY. It is the PURRRFFECT scent for a woman that likes something a bit warmer, muskier and a bit more decadent for themselves. Some women may say it smells like a mens cologne , but that's because we are more swayed towards sugary and fruity smells. This perfume works incredible with my body chemistry.. That being said it will NOT be for EVERYONE. BUT. If you are a girl who generally likes more organic smells , tobacco flower or amber... I'm sure you'll love this fragrance. Perfect for #spring, #summer ,#fall and #winter #smellsgood #aliengirl #loveperfume	positif
227	17081014	This is one of my favourite perfumes and whenever I see my bottle getting low, I try and go out and buy a new one - however it is a little pricey depending how big you want your bottle to be - in my opinion though in regards to the value for money and the price of a good perfume that the price is worth it. The fragrance lasts all day and is a perfume you can actually smell of yourself so you know that other people can too. I love the smell and even converted my mum into buying it - I love it and agree it is value for money. Your bottle lasts a long time as you don't have to spray a lot to get a long lasting scent. 	positif
228	15078453	This was my very first favorite perfume. I remember my birth mom and I getting ready to go out when I was just a little girl. Anytime I get to hang out with her is always a fun time. Anyway, I remember saying I wanted to smell like her. She gave me a few spritz of the Thierry Mugler fragrance. Fast forward to my first homecoming dance, she did my hair and makeup, and then pulled out the perfume. It was a glorious moment. Sorry, I didn't mean to get all nostalgic, but I love this scent for many reasons than just the way it smells. It has memories to me. I recommend it to anyone who wants to smell angelic. It won't fail you.	positif
229	6256311	I really liked this Lacoste Magnectic summertime fragrance. At first it seems a bit strong however this settles very quickly to a pleasant sweet and delicate smell . You do not need to use a lot which is great as the bottle will last longer. It's sweet feminine scent last all day and is a great addition to your summertime wardrobe . I would definitely recommend this and it would be a great as a birthday gift. The femminine pink bottle with the embroidered Lacoste trademark makes the perfume bottle eye catching. I've had several compliments from my colleagues and partner and one of my colleagues has bought the Perfume. Overall a beautiful perfume and i will definitely purchase this in the future!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
230	5241000	First of all, I have the feeling that the reader a few reviews down was smelling something else, as the way they are describing this perfume is completely wrong and weird sounding! The last thing Im getting from this fragrance is spice, or the sense that its for men!!! This is a very floral, pleasant and feminine fragrance. It isnt too intrusive in terms of how far the scent travels, but it definitely isnt shy and people do notice it. It smells luxurious and expensive, however thankfully the price isn't too crazy. If you enjoy florals Im certain youll love this.	positif
231	14787570	"I like this fragrance. I wouldn't want to wear it all the time. I only got a sample to try out in the past. I just used it up today. The opening of this is a little strong at first and smells like some woman's perfume from years ago that went bad.(maybe my vial sample went rancid.) Afterwards it gets better and better. It smells sweet but not too much with woods. During the final stages of the dry down is the best because it has a tropical scent which is caused by the ""Coconut"" note. I really picture wearing this at night in the summer at clubs, casinos etc. This is one of the few fragrances where the ""coconut"" note really stands out for me.:)"	positif
232	15301103	I was pleasantly surprised with this fragrance by Calvin Klein. I often find it difficult to find a perfume I like, as I don't like smelling like everyone else - for me there's nothing worse than smelling your perfume on someone else! I found this fragrance really unique and different! My boyfriend is a big fan and I've also had great comments from my work colleagues. The scent does start strong but settles quickly, leaving a slightly musky, sweet feminine smell while remaining subtle. I do find it wears off fairly quickly and needs to be reapplied, but it's a great daytime fragrance suitable for work etc. I will definitely be buying this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
233	15301113	I've been using my new bottle of Calvin Klein Euphoria perfume over the past week and am slightly disappointed. The perfume smells nice but maybe a little too masculine for my liking (I prefer a floral/fruity scent and I feel like this could be a unisex spray although it is targeted at women). I received some compliments about my new fragrance but when I pushed further none of those people said they liked the smell enough to purchase a bottle themselves (especially when I told them the price). I'd recommend the perfume to a friend - it has good staying power and is fairly reasonable priced but it just isn't to my preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
234	2488297	I think this has become my new favourite perfume. I don't have a signature scent but I like heavy, spicy, musky smells. I own things like Coco, Lou Lou, Joop, Alien and Boss Nuit. This just slots right into those fragrances. I bought it blind after buying the men's one for my partner. My only regret is that I got a small bottle. I bought it from Amazon themselves and it's definitely the real deal. It lasts all day. I've added to it with Secret Obsession. I'm a Calvin Klein convert.	positif
235	10560043	Forever my most favorite perfume Calvin Klein Eternity for Women. This fragrance makes me happy. It is a classic fragrance that has been around for years, but still is just as beautiful as it always has been. I love smelling it in the air. Oddly enough, though, it doesn't always smell the same on my skin when I spray it on, so when I wear this scent I try to put it onto my clothes instead. But oh-so-beautiful. It is a pricier frangrance, but it should be. It is ETERNITY. And I love it.	positif
236	19841615	Calvin Klein Deep Euphoria EDP: I'm not a fan of Calvin Klein perfumes and there was one Euphoria edition that I liked (it reminded my mom's perfume from when I was little) though still wasn't something I would wear. When I was looking for new fragrance in spring, I smelled Deep Euphoria out of curiosity and didn't expect anything, but I fell in love instantly. Usually when I like a scent I'll wear it a few times before deciding if I like it enough to purchase, but Deep Euphoria was love at first sight. I purchased it and never regretted it.	positif
237	11996469	I absolutely love this new scent from Calvin Klein. I recently picked it up at my local Ulta when they had a fragrance gift with purchase promotion going on, and I'm so glad they did because it pushed me to try it out. I read that it is supposedly unisex, but it definitely smells more like a fragrance for women to me. It is not sweet-smelling or flowery like so many other perfumes/sprays for women, but instead has much more of a clean, airy/pure smell that I can't get enough of. I was super pleased to find that it lasts all day, and clearly the bottle is beautiful!	positif
238	4802319	good value, smells great. It is really hard for me to find a fragrance. I have really bad allergies so anything too scenty will have me sneezing all day along with give my a runny eyes &nose.Tender Romance smelled amazing! It is a light noticeable scent that smells clean. It will have your special someone getting closer to get a better smell! Perfect for work, going out, date night.

239	4802335	I recieved a sample of this perfume and I have to say it is an absolutely beautiful fragrance. It is soft and not too strong. I love how you can smell the floral scent with a hint of musk. Perfect for everyday use and also for date nights! My husband loves the smell! He noticed when I was wearing it. The name is absolutely perfect for this perfume. It truly is a tender romance. I would definitely recommend this perfume and I am going to go buy the bigger bottle for myself. I recieved this sample free through influenster, but the opinions are all my own.	positif
240	4985698	My husband and I recently received the . POLOBLUEEDP vox box that Influenster sent us. We love how it smells. It provides a long lasting strong and fresh scent. It is an every day fragrance. It’s very masculine. Perfect for causal and professional activities. He wears it everyday to go to work in the mornings and every time we go out. We recommend this product. If you are looking for a perfume for your husband which smells fresh, strong and masculine, then you must get this one. We received this product complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are our own.	positif
241	5245044	I gave this to a close friend of mine to test out. The fragrance description made him curious and he could immediately smell the coffee and orange notes. He uses a couple of spritzes on his upper body and that is enough. He says the scent lingers for the entire day. While he enjoys the fragrance, I was not so much a fan. While I like the smell of coffee brewing, I don't much care for it in a perfume/cologne; which is why I left off a star. Received this Ralph Lauren Fragrance complimentary for review purposes, but all opinions are our own.	positif
242	10534080	"I absolutely LOVE how this perfume smells! I've been a fan of the original Ralph Lauren Romance fragrance for years, so I was a bit nervous that this iteration wouldn't possibly be able to compete with it, but I am thrilled to have been proven wrong thanks to my latest VoxBox. Tender Romance is a light, sweet take on the original Romance perfume...while they both smell dreamy, they really aren't very similar at all! Tender Romance is a bit brighter and more youthful. It's sweet and happy and fruity whereas the classic Romance is more sophisticated and mellow. Staying power is decent, too! This is definitely a ""happy"", everyday scent for me."	positif
243	25897664	First of all, I've loved every Ralph Lauren fragrance I've ever tried. I wasn't expecting to like this one though (I have this association of things in pink bottles being too sweet and syrupy for my liking) but this perfume is stunning. It smells like juicy fresh cranberry with a little tonka bean. It's a little sour but in a way that I find to be very exhilarating. I love citrus fruits in my perfumes, and the cranberry accomplishes that sharpness that I love but with a scent that stands out in my collection. Ralph never lets me down.	positif
244	4912921	I first smelled this perfume in my newest Cosmo magazine and thought, wow.. this smells like a bar of soap from the Four Seasons or the Fairmont. It's a very clean, crisp unique fragrance. It's a little on the pricy side, but I think it's worth it. The only bad thing I can say about it is, it doesn't last that long. I can usually smell a faint bit of it after an hour of wearing it, but that's it. If you are looking for a unique CLEAN scent though, it's perfect for summer.	positif
245	4841833	sexy, sensual. I first smelled this perfume when I received one of those one time use samples with my Sephora order and it really made the whole package smell incredible. My best friend ended up purchasing it for me since I couldn't stop talking about it. I had read reviews that it doesn't last very long and unfortunately this is true. But I think this is a very sexy and sensual scent and it's very unique. Still my favourite fragrance that I own and I know this will be one that I repurchase over and over again despite the price tag.	positif
246	4840149	I got the rollerball after I loved a sample enough to try it on my skin. Usually fragrances give me a migraine so I've been sticking to all-natural perfumes that do not. This is the first mainstream one that doesn't do that to me. The scent does hug close to your body (which I prefer), so it you're hoping that everyone you pass will be able to smell you, you might be disappointed (although they likely will not be). Smells fantastic and I can still smell it eight hours after putting it on this morning.	positif
247	5932320	This oil is amazing! Super hydrating, but not greasy, and the smell is perfection. I'm not sure how someone could review this product and speak on the scent if they have never smelled the actual fragrance themselves..(ei: the review before me). This smells JUST like the perfume. I've tried all of the beachy fragrances available at Sephora and this one is my . 1! Also, you get ALOT of product for the price. Plus this wears for so long! I had it on all day yesterday! 1000% recommend this! especially if the actual perfume is out of your price range. LOVE LOVE LOVE this!	positif
248	2403765	This has to be one of my favorite perfumes of all time. Both the box and bottle are distinctive while modern and simplistic and are immediately recognizable as Kenzo. The fragrance itself is stunning, somehow powdery and spiced, bohemian and floral. For me, this is reminiscent of Paul Smith Extreme and Jean Paul Gaultier Classique simultaneously.I'm not a perfume expert, so my description doesn't do this fragrance justice at all, however I can honestly say I receive so many comments every time I wear this with one friend even commenting he can smell me the second I enter a room as the aroma is so unique. The perfume is of high quality and the fragrance is really durable, meaning you don't have to spray too much to keep your scent all night.	positif
249	14618123	"My husband purchased Lovestruck for me after I smelled It in a magazine insert and I immediately HAD to have it. I do not like fragrances that seem overly floral or overly sweet and this is the perfect balance. It is not overly feminine and even has, for lack of a better description, a slightly ""masculine"" feel to it. Not that is smells like a men's cologne, it just isn't overly sweet or floral. I have received so many compliments on this. Almost very time I wear it I have someone come up to me and asks me what I'm wearing. Another major plus to this perfume is that the scent does not wear off throughout the day. It also seems to smell better and better throughout the day!"	positif
250	5395394	"i dabble in fragrances. usually only affording cheapo versions (just recently bought an imitation coco madamoiselle), and my mother bought me a bottle for valentine's day in place of the usual candy after wanting to try it for a while. i sprayed it on my girlfriend's hand in the car because she wanted to smell it, and my mother and her boyfriend were overwhelmed, definitely a very strong, blunt scent. i particularly like the perfumes that my mother would describe as ""old lady"" so i love this. it has a very vintage aura. and it is definitely ""mature"" but can be worn by anybody. if you like it, wear it. so unique. it lasts all day and its so powerful i can even smell it on myself during the day. very quality, and the price is great."	positif
251	11171086	I love my White Diamond. Purchased mines from Goody's. I've been wearing White Diamond for about 2 years now and I have yet to wear any other perfume, probably will not because I love this perfume so much. The scent is long lasting. I work 8-10 hours shifts and when I make it home at the end of the day, I still smell the White Diamond perfume on me. Usually I do 1-2 to squirts because that's all I need. I get so many complaints, asking what kind of perfume to I have On and where they can purchase it. 5 out of 5 stars for sure! Elizabeth Arden White Diamonds Fragrance Set	positif
252	5245848	good value. Despite being terribly picky with perfume, this became a staple for me the second I tried it on in-store. It's an amazingly rich floral scent with many layers to it -- smelling it when you put it on is like an experience. As it's long lasting, it leaves you with an elegant and luxurious touch for the rest of the day (I personally usually just use two sprays since it's a decadent fragrance). I think it's also the type of perfume that's appropriate for both young adults and those who are more mature. Can't recommend it enough!	positif
253	19720700	Not your average! I wasn't particularly looking for a new scent, but I was bored waiting for my Sephora apt. and started sniffing around. I came across this bottle and I was absolutely in love. The floral woody smell captures some of my favorite notes. This was a bit more elegant than my everyday wear, so I was thrilled to wear it on a special night out. I was impressed with how long it lasted (literally hours). It wafts a bit strong, but I think that helps make it last. Even wearing it now, I keep catching the perfume and I smile. Definitely worth it if you can handle the bolder fragrances. The price point is fair too.	positif
254	10848002	This is one of my favorite fragrances of all time. It smells so fresh and flirty while being elegant and sophisticated. I always get compliments when I wear this fragrance. I do wish that the eau de parfum was in stock more frequently than just the toilette. The toilette isn't worth purchasing because it doesn't have the longevity of the eau de parfum. It is definitely worth the wait and the price tag difference to get the eau de parfum. This is one of my HG fragrances that I hope that Hermes never discontinues. If you want a scent that isn't overly fruity or floral (which is my issue with most women's fragrances), then you'll love this perfume. :)	positif
255	6678235	When I first bought this I was a little skeptical, but I decided to give it a go. My skin is very sensitive to fragranced perfumes, creams and oils; but when I tried this product it had a clean scent to it. The bar is about the size of your palm and the texture is not bumpy or scratchy so your skin won't feel uncomfortable or hurt. It's great for skin too, it leaves arms and legs feeling very soft, and again it does not have a very strong smell which I like. I lathered it on my face with water and it went on very smoothly, and washes off nicely with no trouble or hassle from residue not washing it off. I definitely recommend this to people who have sensitive skin and don't like fragrance filled products.	positif
256	16731251	I've been getting this fragrance for a couple of years now and I won't love another bath and body works perfume as much as this one! It's SO sweet and makes the skin smells so amazing through the day. It feels and smells just like a high-end perfume. It is aloe infused and I'm in love with how smooth my skin stays with this scent . Other perfumes just feels like scented alcohol and this one feels so smooth in a way and doesn't make me feel bad for dousing it on this skin and clothes. The packaging is so appealing and beautiful. 10/10!	positif
257	4991965	good value. I admit I'm a perfume person lol. I love perfume and buy all of them from Sephora. This fragrance smells excellent. If you are a person who loves a fresh clean almost like just got out of the showers scent this is it. A nurse in a hospital I was in had it on and of course I had to ask. She smelled great. They only carry. It online and the fragrance is not a perfume . There is whole line Of different smells. They sell a sampler of I think 12 samples from the one line to try. It really smells great. Strangers stop and ask me. You should try it. Go to store and ask for a sample. Go for it!	positif
258	5101153	good value, travel-friendly. Love every scent in this set! Got several compliments wearing Lady Vengeance the first time. These perfumes smell fresh and vibrant, unlike other lines of fragrance. I ordered the Histoires de parfums at the same time, with the intention of giving one of the sets to my mother for christmas. I tested a few from the HdP, and immediately decided she would be getting that one. Definitely more suited to my old school mom. (though 1969 was really really nice). Some of the scents in this set are rather androgynous, which I really like. Definitely give it a try if you want to switch up your fragrances and stand out.	positif
259	5452635	This was Emanuel Ungaro’s first perfume created by the great perfumer Jacques Polge in 1983, who has created many famous fragrances, particularly for the house of Chanel. This is a classic, elegant, floral perfume for women built around roses. It opens with a citrusy note, which harmonizes with tuberose and Ylang-ylang mixed with rose. This is sweet with honey, ginger, cinnamon and vanilla. I see this as a gourmand scent. Always have. It smells very glamorous, luxurious and beautiful. The opening has a top note of mandarin orange citrus that I love, along with the aldehydes. Before long the rose blooms and it becomes apparent that this is a bold rose perfume with jasmine, tuberose, and narcissus nicely complementing the rose. The only word for this fragrance is --- sexy!	positif
260	4684821	Never had this experience with a fragrance before. First time I bought a perfume without smelling it. Had to have that bottle. It's like they designed it just for me. Smelled the perfume direct from the bottle. Hated it. Smells like fake flowers and cleaning agent. Sprayed the perfume on my pulse points. Same. 15 minutes later the scent transforms into the loveliest, sweetest, yet peppery aroma and it makes my head spin with endorphins. Have been using it for a week and same thing every time. It is beautiful and mysterious the way it works. I've been swept off my feet by this perfume. Well done.	positif
261	4734269	good value. I am loving this perfume! I was in my local Sephora today and saw this perfume! Like some of the other reviews when I first sprayed it on my wrist I hated it. I was upset because I really wanted to like it because I wanted the bottle. After roughly 45 minutes to an hour after leaving, I noticed that I started liking the smell. I have been smelling my wrist the rest of the day. I typically do not like scents like this. I normally love the really sweet and fruity fragrances. I actually am about to place an order for the 1 oz size! :) I would say to definitely try this scent in person and give it a little time. It is really weird how this fragrance works!	positif
262	24656068	Great Fragrance! This is one of my favorite fragrances. Many perfumes do not mix well with my body chemistry, but this is one of the few that does. I know this is described as a floral, which I do detect some of, but on me it dries down as this wonderful soft and almost powdery scent. Very clean and fresh. It is work-friendly and great for nights out as well. It doesn’t have amazing staying power, but I don’t mind because it smells so good on me and I find it to be a very unique fragrance.	positif
263	5612230	I received this in the April Play by Sephora box and I absolutely love it! It is on the stronger side and I agree with the reviewer who stated it's more unisex, so if you're more into very feminine fragrances this may not be for you. However, if you enjoy floral fragrances (specifically the scent of lilies) and you like perfumes that are not sweet smelling this may be great for you! I'd always suggest trying it out in the store first though if you're unsure, perfumes can smell different on each wearer depending on their chemistry.	positif
264	18492549	This is my new favorite foundation! I have dark spots and acne marks on my skin, I only. Need a tiny bit for awesome skin! I absolutely loved it! I will be ordering more once my color comes back in stock! I have dry skin and the demi matte finish doesn't bother me because it still gives me a healthy glow! I will warn you! The fragrance is quite strong! Is smells like perfume was accidentally spilled in the product , but it's a nice scent! If you are not a fan a fragrances. Beware! I have recommended this foundation to so many people!!!	positif
265	4779143	Bought this with my points and I love the scent. it is suitable for Spring = because it is start with fresh green cut mixed flower and settle down with a powdery musk with a hint of fresh flower. Longevity of the fragrance on me, is moderate it could last up to 8 hours very softly. Hint I spray also on the back of my neck, that will also make my hair smells like the perfume. Sillage according to my colleagues not to strong or very gentle and does not linger. Which I like for the office use. I don't like to become room freshener if the sillage is so strong. I wear this in the day time to the office.	positif
266	24665144	"LOVE As soon as I smelled this on one of those fragrance card testers in the store I was like ""Whoa!"" I love sweet scents (I wore the That's So Raven perfume and the Aquolina Pink Sugar in high school) and this is a lighter, more mature scent. On me it's straight up orange blossom, raspberry, marshmallow, and a teeny-tiny hint of musk. Delicious! My mom also tells me that it's very nice and ""smells like you"" when I wear it. This is one you can wear year round. In the summer it's nice and light, not cloying or syrupy. In the winter it's a comforting cloud of fruity sweetness."	positif
267	25767764	NEW FAVORITE! I wasn’t looking for a new perfume, but usually spray one on just for fun when I go to Sephora. Tried Dolce & Gabbana Dolce Garden several weeks ago and couldn’t get the beautiful scent out of my mind. It’s softly sweet, with a gardenia/magnolia note and definitely coconut. It reminds me of a breeze on a beach. Lasts a long time on me, so much so that there is a faint smell left on my wrists when I wake up in the night after spraying it that morning. My new favorite fragrance. For reference, I also wear Chanel Chance, Michael Kors 24K Gold, Tom Ford Eau du Soleil, and Marc Jacobs Daisy collection.	positif
268	4813268	I stopped wearing fragrances sold in Sephora and like stores because they just weren't exciting anymore; everything started to smell the same. I've been wearing Jo Malone for a few years now and decided to stop in Sephora for a new lip shade when I met my new favorite fragrance!!! It's perfect for me! FYI: it is possible the pickle scent some are picking up is due to the acidic levels in their bodies. I love decadence, all other MJ perfumes were too girlie and innocent for my taste. I will be purchasing the lotion as well. The name is so fitting!	positif
269	4923503	I bought the rollerball size of Dot in the spring so I could test the fragrance out before committing to a huge bottle. This is definitely one of my new favs! I love perfumes that balance sweet, fruity, and floral notes---especially when there are berries! This scent isn't so young-smelling that it makes you smell like a 10 year old who bathes in cotton candy,, but it also doesn't age you and make you smell like your grandma. It's classy but still playful. If/when I finish the rollerball, I'm buying a larger size for sure!	positif
270	5215719	good value. I bought the bigger bottle a year ago and the bottle is still a little under the half way mark even with everyday use. A little goes a long way but sometimes I just love to bathe myself in it because the scent is just so yummy. I ALWAYS get compliments on how good I smell and questions about the perfume from strangers or friends sitting near me, boyfriends hugging me and even stepping into uber cars! Definitely a beautiful floral fragrance, I haven't smelled anything like it. I'm sad it's running out and will try something else soon... MAYBE!	positif
271	4841747	I first smelled this as a sample in a magazine, and even in there it smelled amazing. It is even better in person! Deep, sexy scent - nothing innocent about this fragrance! The perfume itself is amazing. It comes in the shape of a mini handbag, which is so unique and cute to my. The shower gel is luxurious, but I wish a lotion had been included as well, or instead of the shower gel (only because it does not make sense to using a scented product that you'll be washing off right away). I like the velvet, luxe box that it came in too. Perfect for storing out-of-the-way documents like tax returns but in a pretty way.	positif
272	19636115	Sexy Old Hollywood Glamour This new Marc Jacobs fragrance smells incredibly sexy old Hollywood glamour! It lasts a very long time and you can tell that it is high-quality. The packaging is super cute and stylish. Who would’ve thought to make a perfume in the shape of a purse! Marc Jacobs is a very well-known name and each product they put out on the market is very thought out and intriguing. I would highly recommend this fragrance. It is the first sexy scent I have tried. Usually my go to fragrance is Burberry Brit but I love how different this Marc Jacobs fragrance is and I will continue to flaunt it. I received this product complementary for review purposes.	positif
273	19636231	Great for a Young Professional This perfume smells absolutely amazing! It has a floral scent but it’s not overbearing. This is the type of perfume that you could easily wear in a professional setting without smelling way too strong! The only complaint I have on both the full size and the same size that I received is that I don’t think the shape of the bottle makes it very travel friendly. It’s gorgeous, but I just worry that something will happen to it if it’s in a purse or a bag! I received this product from Influenster and Marc Jacobs Fragrances in exchange for my honest review! .

274	15381315	"This was my first ""big girl"" fragrance purchase, and it really made me fall in love with them. This one is so unique. It's fresh and clean and light and smells unlike any other fragrance I've ever smelled. It's not your typical lineney, citrusy fresh perfume. It really does smell like fresh rain with a little bit of cotton or something. It's definitely more of an everyday, daytime scent, but I find myself wearing it out at night anyway because I love it so much! So sad it was limited edition. I hope they rerelease it!"	positif
275	19922210	On one of my many trips to Ulta, I walked pass a lady in the store that smelled so good I just had to ask the name of the fragrance she was wearing. She told me she had just sampled Honey by Marc Jacobs. It was the holiday season so Ulta had gift sets available for sale of that very perfume. I just had to have it since it smelled so good! I love perfumes and usually try to buy them when gift sets are available because I feel like I get more for my money since perfumes have become so expensive. I quickly grabbed up one of the few giftsets available and purchased it. The fragrance is a light flowery scent that tends to linger. I am very satisfied with my purchased and the added lotion for the same price as the perfume alone makes my purchase worth it.	positif
276	19077888	I received a free trial of Aura MUGLER perfume in exchange for my review. The first time I wore this perfume, I didn't like it at all. It wasn't something that I absolutely couldn't stand the smell of, but I just didn't care for it. My daughter and my husband both liked it though so I thought I would give it another chance the next day. I can honestly say I liked it a little better the next day. It has a very unique smell. The scent is not very strong, but it is very long lasting. I think the advent is growing on me. AURA MUGLER Fragrance	positif
277	6248154	An instant favourite of mine, I love it! Lavish packaging and glamorous design set the mark for it's stunningly powerful full on long lasting fragrance. It's sweet with a woody aroma and seductively sophisticated. A definite choice for a beautifully rich and sexy scent. When sprayed onto the skin it's devine smell makes you feel uplifted and will remind you how gorgeous it is for hours after, you can't help but enjoy it. It puts the finishing touch to an outfit and makes you feel fabulous! It's absolutely worth spending that bit extra on this, no need to spray too much and so it will last that bit longer. Being a lover of intense, strong, sweet, sandalwood & violet type perfumes, this is a forever must have of mine now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
278	6248197	Trying a new perfume I am always concerned that it wont last all day. No need to worry on this one though. Not only is the bottle beautiful and I did feel so decandant taking it out of the packaging with its soft touch box and tissue paper wrapped lid (who doesnt love unwrapping items in tissue paper) but the smell is fresh and screams dinner date! which is exactly wear I wore it for its first outing. And better still my husband noticed its fragrance immediately (and thats a good test with my other half) as well as commenting on how delicate the scent was. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
279	6248254	The perfume comes in a lovely bottle with an amazing lid that is three flowers put together. This alone would draw me straight to the perfume as I love a beautiful bottle. As you would expect, the scent itself smells just like a meadow of daisy's and is really fresh. It is great for everyday wear and I especially like to wear it to work. The only downside to this perfume is that I would not chose to wear it on a night out as it is very fresh and not something I would associate with a night out with friends or an evening meal. That being said, it is a lovely fragrance that I will use for everyday wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
280	14306631	I was never really one to have a perfume/fragrance before I came to college, but I decided that I wanted a smell that was ME. Bath & Body Works has a billion scents so I went through quite a few before I came across this one, and the minute I smelled it, I knew it was me. It's sweet and somehow, like its name suggests, it gives off a warm scent. I love it-- it's the perfect mix between girly but also quite womanly/warm. Highly recommend! I even have the body lotions/creams to go along with this mist.	positif
281	23023405	This perfume is delicious I cannot stop sniffing my wrist when I wear it. It truley is addictive I have the 2014 edition I’ve never smelled the previous 2 but I would like to smell the 2002 version if ever an opportunity arises. To the scent I adore the white florals in this! I adore Sambac Jasmine and orange blossom add in some citrus plus the bourbon vanilla and wow what a fragrance! This on me is very long lasting it goes strong for hours and hours on my skin. The sillage can be quite strong but I find it perfect for my taste. I purchased the 1.7 ounce but want the 100ml as soon as I can at least before they change the formula again. I love Dior but what annoys me about their scents is the constant reformulation. I get there are new laws and rules but it’s hard to keep track. But with Addict I feel that this is lovely I hear the 2002 had monster awesome sillage which I would love but I’m just glad the scent hasn’t changed too much. I love the bottle the silver and blue is beautiful and this has a great nozzle. This is expensive but a few sprays go a long way and it’s a beautifully addictive fragrance that I know I do not want to be without. I love vanilla and white flowers I feel the 2 are so good together plus the mandarin leaf make such a lovely perfume. Love!	positif
282	5836931	I was on the lookout for a new scent, as I'm interested in cultivating my fragrance collection. I currently wear Coco Mademoiselle, which I love, but I wanted something more. Something sophisticated and alluring. I went to Sephora and was spraying fragrance after fragrance when I stumbled upon this. I had my eye on Black Opium, but when I smelled it, it reminded me too much of Coco. I didn't expect to like it, because I do not like any of his current fragrances I've smelled. I also am an amateur in terms of the notes and sillage and things like that. I barely even register what the smells are, just that I like them. The top notes are more floral, a bit citrusy. But the middle notes are what got me. It turns into something sweeter, but musky too. It makes me feel like I'm strutting down the street at night, turning heads as I go. I feel confident and sexy, something I didn't think I would say due to a perfume. I also still smelled it on my wrist this morning, so it definitely lasts. The scent is strong, so be aware that it is not for the faint of heart who prefer fresh, light fragrances. Some reviews say it's for winter or a night out, but I'm wearing this wherever and whenever I please. Although it's pricey, I think if it makes you feel great, it's worth the splurge.	positif
283	1602815	The first thing I, as every other woman does with any liquid beauty product, is to smell of it. I have never smelled this fragrance in any other hair product... it's a very warm, natural, Sunday morning pancake syrup scent, that just relaxes all of my senses. Floral and perfume scents have never appealed to me very much. But, this shampoo along with the matching conditioner make for a relaxing aromatherapy shower experience. I have to say, you don't need a lot of this shampoo to get a nice silky lather. It reminds me more of a professional salon product than most others that seem watered down. I colored my hair right before shampooing, just to see how well it would get all the color out, and to see if it would strip my hair further. It did not. It only took two shampoos to wash away all the color and it felt as if my hair had been replenished quite a bit, as well. It was not oily, or waxy or layered with silicone to make it feel smoother. It just felt lightly conditioned. This is not usually how my hair feels after freshly shampooing out color before conditioning. My hair felt and smelled so good. I followed the shampoo up with the Garnier Whole Blends Maple Conditioner, and my hair felt, and was in much better condition than before coloring. And, the smell... It really is the best I've ever smelled in a shampoo and conditioner. I hope that Garnier adds styling products to this line with the same luxurious scent. #WholeBlends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
284	4948121	pricy, long lasting, flirty. My first reaction to this was that it was the more successful baby of Parisienne and Black Opium, featuring the best notes of each, and running with those, it created something miles ahead of them.One of the most important things to me in a fragrance is its lasting power, and though I'll make exceptions for niche perfumes (see Tokyomilk Dark) or quick-fixes (see BB's or VS's body mist collections) a short-lived scent is a deal breaker for me. I didn't expect much at first, because despite how much I adore the YSL fragrances, so many of them (looking at you Black Opium) just do not last.This perfume I was able to try a few weeks ago as an exclusive preview, and it lasted HOURS on my skin (at least six, and then only vanished because I showered) and over five days on the sample card. That being said, its not a super-strong scent, the distance it goes is respectable, and it doesn't assault the senses like the Opium collection does; its more unique than Parisienne, and much finer in its note composition than Manifesto, its grown-up without being a safe office perfume, and playful without smelling like high school in a bottle. Its a medium floral with fruit notes, and the white musk blends perfectly in with some of the heavier fruits to maintain the chord. No patchouli in sight!	positif
285	4852784	beautiful, long-lasting, light-weight, floral, decadent, scent is amazing. I personally never bought this fragrance before because its pretty expensive and although I am a perfume lover, I could never justify spending that much money on a single parfum no matter how good it smells lol. I was very excited to be one of the few bloggers selected to receive a “Viktor & Rolf Vox Box” from Influenster introducing this brand’s new product before its official release. The “Flowerbomb Precious Oil” is a decadent and creative way of prolonging the already alluring Flowerbomb scent. By simply adding and letting seep in 1-2 drops of this oil onto your pulse points in combination with the actual Flowerbomb parfum or body creme, this light-weight oil magnifies their ingredients creating a pleasant explosion of florals sure to captivate your senses all day long. The precious oil’s beautiful glass bottle and dropper are very pleasing to the eye and in true Viktor & Rolf parfum fashion, do not disappoint. Even when you finish the oil, you can still recycle the bottle, clean it out and add something else in you’d like to use on a regular. I think this is a genius product that undoubtedly prevents you from using too much of your perfume spray on a daily basis. I see this becoming a hot new trend in the fragrance industry, definitely a must-have in your beauty arsenal!	positif
286	18627861	I fell in love with Shalimar Parfum Initial first which I think allowed me to love and appreciate Shalimar. At first I just thought it wouldnâ€™t be for me. But how wrong was I. I kept having a hard time getting over the leather note. But as I wore this I noticed such wonderful scents like incense and vanilla. I also love the citrus in Shalimar I think they smell so good. But as this fragrance develops on my skin it just kept getting better and better. I could smell floral but what I love most about this is the drydown. On my skin this smells like heaven! The sandalwood and tonka mixed with the vanilla and incense just blew my mind. I canâ€™t believe this has been around for so long because yes it does smell vintage but at the same time thereâ€™s something timeless about it that makes it current.I do not think this is an old lady scent and I hate that term so much. I think if you like something and it makes you happy comments like that just donâ€™t matter. This perfume is one of my favorites the sillage and longevity are excellent I spray this and I can still smell it the next day as a wonderful skin scent. This is a number one fragrance for a lot of reasons and Iâ€™m so happy I enjoy it as well. I think it smells amazing. My signature is Parfum Initial but I will wear this on special occasions or just when I want to smell a piece of history. My sig other loves this on me as well. Amazing perfume I would love to get a vintage bottle or the parfum. Love!	positif
287	5399383	"Tuscany Per Dona was a fragrance I wore in the early 2000s. My husband rarely commented on any perfume I wore with the exception of Tuscany. He loved the way it smelled on me and would ask me to wear it often. I had put it away in favor of trendy perfumes. Just recently while shopping I saw the department store had it back in stock. It took one sniff before I fell in love with it all over again and wondered why I had stopped wearing such a beautiful perfume. The combination of sandalwood, jasmine, amber and vanilla is so warm and rich. Each compliments the other to make it's own unique scent. It is not a perfume for the ""bubble gum"" crowd but it's not what is referred to as an ""old lay perfume"" either. To me, this perfume says""I am woman, classy, and sexy."" Tuscany Per Dona doesn't announce itself when you enter a room or lingers after you have left. The person standing next to you will lean in to get a better whiff and then tell you how good you smell. I've had more compliments on this perfume than any others I've worn in several years. The staying power is 3 to 6 hours on me unfortunately. I hope it works with your chemistry because it is a classy scent."	positif
288	5419920	"I've been obsessed with Bonne Bell Skin Musk (Oil, EDT, the spray can) forever & I love Jovan Musk, Body Fantasy Fresh White Musk Fantasy, & my personal fave: Fresh & Pretty White Musk (got this at Dollar general never saw again! But it is divine). I have this in EDT, body spray, body cream, & body wash (& I am going to order the oil when I get paid), I love this scent but it does not last very long I must say. I hope the oil lasts longer. I don't really think Body Fantasy Sexiest Musk is all that. But this IS ""ALL -THAT- A BAG OF CHIPS N A BOX OF HO-HO's"" I never go to TBS so I was never exposed to this & I decided to blind buy off eBay not too long ago I was disappointed I couldn't smell it 5 mins later. But not TOO disappointed coz about 99% of perfumes I can't detect ten minutes later on my own self. I adore this scent! And it's cruelty free. It's not marginally $$$ excessively like a lot of perfumes (excluding VS/B&BW fare or celeb fragrance renditions). Pretty, nice, inoffensive, safe, white bread McDonald's 7up vanilla ice soft serve ice cream cones. Which are all things I happen to find positive."	positif
289	19712211	I'm a Lady and went with the Men's Discovery Set Jazz Club - Spicy, boozy, warm and sultry/playful By the Fireplace - Cozy chestnuts, vanilla and campfire Barber Shop - Expensive smelling classic shaving cream I took at a look at both discovery sets and knew the Men's set was going to fit me better. Beach Walk and Lazy Sunday Morning are too light for me and while unique, would bore me. Both sets (For Men, For Women) share Jazz Club even though the full size bottle claims it is For Men. I agree that it's very unisex and compliments the skin in different ways for both men and women. The unisex scent in this collection is By the Fireplace. On the full bottle, it says unisex and indeed, it is. That's why labeling perfume is kinda messy. They put a For Men frag in the Women's kit and a Unisex frag in the Men's kit... I regress... At the Barber's reminds of classic Old Spice and expensive smelling shaving cream; similar to less grungy Dior Savage to my nose. ATB is the least unisex scent in this collection but on the right lady would also smell fantastic. It becomes more peppery/aromatic on a lady and has enough sweetness to blend in as a unisex fragrance. It's okay on me, but I'm giving it to my boyfriend since it will smell even better on him.	positif
290	5093499	good value, travel-friendly, fresh. I bought this during the VIB Rouge sale, because 20% off is substantial for fragrances. I don't buy fragrance that often, but I love fresh and lightly fruity fragrances that are not heady. I generally don't go for strong floral or woodsy scents. For reference, I own only Giorgio Armani's Acqua di Gio for women circa 1998, Victoria's Secret Pink, Victoria's Secret Bombshell (original scent only), and a Thai jasmine perfume with gold leaf that I reserve for very special occasions. Thai jasmine is not heady as some other jasmine flowers are, they are very sweet and light by comparison, and I only need a tiny amount of it, too. These fragrances are literally the only ones I have ever purchased. (when I was young, my mom gave me freebies from gift with purchase of various things) Usually when I go around smelling things at the store, some are nice, but I don't indulge and splurge, because I use fragrance rather infrequently. I've always liked the scents in the Burberry Brit line when checking them out locally, but I just felt somehow last weekend that the Sheer got to me, somehow I figured this was the time to grab it up. My daughter (elementary school) loves the scent, also. For the price of the bottle, you get the lotion and purse sized spray in a very neatly laid out box. I have it on today, and it meshes with the Herbivore coconut texturizing hair spray well, too. Lovely.	positif
291	6183526	travel-friendly. I received Kat Von D's Saint and Sinner Eau de Parfum...but which do I prefer?!?!? Sinner’s key notes are Vanilla, Musk, Jasmine and Saint’s key notes are Patchouli, Wood, Cinnamon. My pick, Saint. Thank goodness because the name Sinner was a bit bothersome. It’s a personal thing. I generally don’t prefer perfumes with vanilla undertones but Saint is a hit. It smells soft and sensual. The musk undertone blended with the jasmine notes evens out the smell of vanilla to make for a perfect blend. In contrast, Sinner smells strong and heavy. The patchouli really jumps out at you. It would be a great fragrance at night and/or for a mature woman...like a really mature, if you get what I mean. I’d definitely gift this to my mom because she loves heavy smelling perfumes. You know, the kind of scent that will smell long after you’ve left the area and not in a good way. Yeah, that…Saint, however, offers a softer experience and is great for day or night.

I was blindly given two scent strips and asked to pick my favorite. One was musky and spicy; One a warm and vanilla-sweet scent that smelled like peaches and brown sugar mixed with maybe clove or cinnamon....they were Sinner and Saint, respectively. I was immediately taken with Saint. I loved that you can layer and combine the two for different dimensions of fragrance but Saint is just such a heavenly mixture of fruit and spice. It has a floral fruit note, like the blossoms from trees, so it is not overly sweet. The warmth is like a caramelized vanilla, dark and rich but far from overbearing. It smells sophisticated, like you're wearing something worthy of praise and value, and you can tell the combination of notes is far from a cheap perfume arrangement. Kat Von D is known for honing her craft and only pushing products to production when she feels they are one-hundred percent perfect in her design's eye and this is no exception. I think she did a phenomenal job curating two opposite yet compatible scents and I can't wait to add Sinner to my collection, but for now, I am thrilled to have been gifted Saint. I will sing this perfume praises for a long time to come and I challenge anybody that initially didn't like it to give it another chance...it's amazing.	positif
294	5140771	This scent is really nice! It's one of the top fragrances I've tried on my skin during my search for an amazing perfume. (Decadence being one .. I know totally diff smells and notes)..It (play) has a clean smell, think coco mademoiselle (a semi favorite too), yet this one is more Muskier and seductive at the same time. I personally don't like the whole clean, fresh, light , soapy scent, which is what those two portray to my nose senses haha , but this one is amazing! I liked it as I was walking out and kept smelling my outer hand for it the most , more than the other spots I sprayed with two-three other samples...i liked the older bottle that has the rewind,forward, and play thing going on like a remote but I think the newer version does not have it as they may have updated it. Id just change the color because I don't like pink all that much.. Not a real problem as the smell is great! A success in my eyes! I think I liked it as soon as it sprayed out! The die down to me , kinda stays the same throughout...Just spray some onto your skin and see how it plays out & interacts with you! No pun intended haha!	positif
295	10288824	The Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector definitely lives up to the highlighter hype. For those of you who want that highlight to pop, this product is great for use either alone or under a powder highlight. It's very versatile for use either on the face or the body, and the great thing is that you can mix it into your lotion or foundation. I only have a few qualms about this product. This product does have a strong fragrance to it. It smells heavily of vintage perfume. I'm not sure if this is because mine is a dud though as I also have a deluxe sized sample of this and it does not have this scent. The pump is also hard to control. Sometimes I just want a little bit to highlight my cheekbones, but even with the utmost care, too much is dispensed, which wastes the product. Granted, there is a lot of product inside, but it would be nice to have a pump that is easier to use. Also, the plastic cap is quite fragile as mine has cracked. All in all, assuming that the perfume scent in mine was just a dud issue, it's a great product for those of you who want the strong highlight and the versatility of a liquid highlighter; however, with that said, I can't say it's my favorite highlighter nor do I think I would repurchase this due to the fact that there are lots of other highlighters to try out on the market.	positif
296	4908955	if you love patchouli, this will be your holy grail scent. if you hate patchouli, this will repel you to the highest heavens. tom ford is genius. he created a fragrance that captures pure patchouli oil (one that has been sitting around for over 10 years and thus matured into something majestic) , blended it with mosses and herbs, marketed it and made fashion editors salivate. The same fashion editors that turned their noses up to the scent of pure patchouli, noting it was hippy and dirtyLOL! Oh, the irony. Anyway.... I LOVE this fragrance because I adore patchouli. This is dirty, raw, earthy patchouli that lasts and lasts and lasts. It makes a scene and is NOT for the faint of heart.A little dab goes a LONG way and LASTS - I put some on yesterday in the morning, took TWO showers, slept, and it's still... there. quite potent, just like pure patchouli oil.People don't know what real patchouli smells like and just assume it's that modernized stuff they throw into nearly all perfumes. No no no... THIS is real patchouli bottled with a tangy pairing of other players, but patchouli STEALS the show. If you don't want to spend over $200 and are curious, go to your health store and get some patchouli oil (make sure it's pure) for under $10 and then decide if this is something you enjoy, for patchouli absolu is NOT a blind buy nor for people who recoil at the thought, or smell of patch.	positif
297	10541143	I love PRINCESS. I remember the first time I wore this beautiful perfume portraying Cinderella on Disney Cruise Lines about a year ago this month. I have also worn it as Princess Aurora Sleeping Beauty. It suits the Disney Princess costumes and I could see myself wearing this as Snow White, Ariel or Elsa from Frozen. This is a very soft powdery little perfume. The design of the bottle is adorable in the shape of a heart adorned with a crown. The fragrance I can describe as being fruity, floral, amber woodsy. I don't think this has any musk. My mother who is in her 60's wears a lot of musky perfumes and this is so not a musk. I can smell the apricot, the tangerine and something orange, not entirely citric, probably the pairing of mimosa and orange blossom. This is a perfume with little power it's a soft scent and probably lasted about 2 hours but I wasn't keeping track of time. It's sold as an adult fragrance but the design of the bottle and the scent itself is really youthful, like it's actually a perfume a mom AND her under-18 daughter can both wear. This is a dreamy delicate perfume that I have loved for a long time. I recommend this perfume for women who are young at heart and who want to feel like the princess she knows she is.	positif
298	5948397	Taylor is a complex fragrance, upon first spray you are immediately hit with the scents of apricot and lychee. Whilst the lychee note fades away after about an hour, the apricot not remains the prominent hero note from beginning to end. After lychee note fades, the perfume's heart smells strongly of apricot and cream with just a hint of sandalwood. The base note continues to showcase the apricot but features woody notes and allows the floral notes and musky notes to shine. This perfume is lovely at all stages. It is a warm and sweet scent, through and through, though it is not sugary at all. It does smell different to other celebrity fragrances on the market and is not at all like Taylor Swift's Wonderstruck range. Taylor is a lovely, fruity floral fragrance which I believe will be enjoyed by many. This would be perfect for spring and summer and a great scent for anyone who likes fruity scents - just make sure they enjoy apricot as this is an apricot fragrance through and through. My only complaint is that the bottle is pretty tacky, it's obviously inspired by Pucci and I'm not a fan of the fake pearls. However, as this does not detract from my enjoyment of the fragrance itself I will not deduct a lippy for this. I would highly recommend this fragrance.Top Notes: Lychee, Tangerine, Magnolia Petals.Heart Notes: Peony, Vanilla Orchid, Hortensia.Base Notes: Sandalwood, Apricot, Woody Notes, Cashmere Musk.	positif
299	19613021	Last year,I received hidden fantasy as a birthday gift from a very dear friend who knew I collect Britney fragrances.I liked it from the first minute but not too much.this year,I find myself reaching for it more often and liking it a lot more.I've used up half of my 3.4oz bottle and I feel I may miss it after going through this bottle and I may decide to repurchase itI usually don't like citrus scents but hidden fantasy is not a sharp,sour,zesty or too much fresh one,it's a warm citrus scent thanks to vanilla and creamy sandalwood.unlike other people,I can't pickup spices here.it smells really like orange-vanilla homemade cookies and I find this scent very comforting in these cold winter days.though orange and vanilla are first actors,I don't find it overly sweet or childish.I don't wear it in formal occasions or nights out but I use it a lot as an everyday,casual perfume and nights that I'm at homeAll Britney perfumes have very good longevity on my skin and hidden fantasy is no exception.I like fantasy bottles and I love to collect them all.this deep red round glass bottle with pink gemstones is among prettier ones	positif
300	23309511	"Sometimes—and I'm not a perfumer, obviously—it seems more difficult to create something fairly linear, since it will usually be a reinvention of the wheel. I think there's something to be said for Lady Vengeance's inclusion in the JHAG line. Every fragrance house (rose) has its rose scent (thorn). I also have the sampler pack, and this is the only scent I can wear (out of those included). That's not to say I don't like the others, I do like some—but either they turn weird on my skin eventually, or they're just not *me.* Smelling like something for hours is a very personal and complicated business. For example, I love woody scents and Another Oud just does not work on me. And I usually greatly dislike rose-based perfumes, but Lady Vengeance DOES work on me. The Great and Terrible Thing about fragrance is that it's so subjective, and there are so many variables at play. Anyway, back to Lady Vengeance. The listed notes are Bulgarian rose, patchouli, lavender, and vanilla. I have simple feelings about this fragrance—I think it smells delicious. So good. That's not to say I don't have a complicated thought process about it though. This is a cool, clean, fresh rose. The patchouli grounds it a bit, though it's not a main player at all (unlike a lot of other rose + patch scents I have tried, the patchouli doesn't bloom, if you will). It's definitely there, though. The vanilla is barely detectable to my nose, but there is a creamy skin-like element that it adds to the mix. I think the lavender is the key component in this fragrance. Lavender is such a ubiquitous scent. It's in soaps, shampoos, laundry detergents, air fresheners, the outdoors if you're lucky. It's everywhere, and usually in a low-quality incarnation, so it's easy to forget how nice it can smell, and how homey and comforting it can be. It's possible this note is what makes a lot of people feel this scent is too ""generic"" or boring. But I think it's kind of genius. Rose, patchouli, and vanilla is a trio that can be found in a ton of fragrances for a reason—each is the epitome of what they traditionally olfactorily represent (flowers, earthiness, sweetness) and in tandem, usually create a round, well-balanced and scent that is now open for hundreds of variations on a theme. And I'm pretty sure this theme can safely be described as feminine and seductive. Also, disclaimer: I'm not that well versed in the history of perfume (and am often awed by some of you reviewers who can list and describe hundreds of fragrances throughout the annals of time), so forgive me if this is straight copycat-ism, but I have never smelled a rose scent with the inclusion of lavender before Lady Vengeance (that I remember, and if I don't remember, then it wasn't worth it anyways, right?). So, as I see it, taking the rose/patchouli/vanilla age-old combo of seduction, and adding lavender, a scent associated with innocence, cleanliness, purity (images of fields of French lavender grown in convents, for god's sake), is almost subversive. It creates a sort of cognitive dissonance that you can't quite place right away. And the things that historically have drawn me to them usually have that quality, be it fragrance or art, food, design—whatever. It's not even that it adds an innocent side to the sexiness, or that it challenges one's perception of what defines sex appeal. It's not really that straightforward. It's almost as if the lavender takes the form of a mischievous little imp traveling into the psyche through your nostrils, just messing around with your scent memory wiring. It's what it does BEFORE you have a chance to think about it and figure it out. It's like you're walking down the street on a sunny day and you keep catching a play of the light, keep turning your head to see it, but it's never there. So you keep walking, but now an avenue has been created where one didn't exist before. And that's not even mentioning how manipulating the impression of familiarity (lavender) against perceived exoticism (rose, patchouli, vanilla) creates another kind of psychic contrast.And it still smells good! Lol.When I wear it, I feel like I smell good, like really great, and it gives me a certain confidence without getting into that really dirty, sexy fragrance territory. Since the Stalwart Trio are all in their more reserved incarnations yet still projecting their respective vibes, it stays just one step back, like the three seconds before a kiss (...a good kiss). It warms up on the skin nicely but never ""turns"" on me. It has medium throw and decent longevity. It's fairly expensive. I kind of hate the bottle. And the lavender keeps me sniffing, trying to catch that imp."	positif
301	10995484	first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine, about a year ago. Every time she walked by me I got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. So, I finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. I'd never heard of it, so I jumped online and looked it up, found a bottle and bought it. I couldn't wait to try it out, so when the perfume finally arrived I put it right on. Imagine my disappointment when I smelled a scent totally unlike the one I'd experienced. On me it was overpoweringly musky, nothing like the seductive fragrance I'd smelled on my colleague. But, an odd thing happened. I didn't wash it right off, and when I smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume I'd fallen in love with. In fact, the longer I wore it the better it smelled. Obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. Now, I wear it when I go out in the evenings, and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. If you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly, as I did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. You only need to use a little, and it lasts for HOURS.	positif
302	5128355	I loved the original Miu Miu, initially. I went through two big bottles of it and finally just got bored. Seeing a new fragrance by Miu Miu was exciting and I jumped at the chance and blind-bought the rollerball. It is decently priced for 0.33oz but the rollerball itself seems cheaply made and I'd have preferred it was a spray.The fragrance itself is not at all like the original. I was expecting a softer version, a Mui Mui lite but this is entirely different. I do not think it fits their description of 'youthful, coloful, unique' but that is no bad thing and this perfume is instead 'soft, feminine, captivating'. I actually find this scent to be more akin to something youd expect from an expensive French lotion due to its floral creaminess. L'eau Bleue is similar in scent to a hair product I use by Ouai, again no bad thing. This frag is quite lovely, it is unassuming, simple, gentle, creamy and awash with white florals. No single note rises above any other, there are no harsh citrus note, no sickening vanilla or caramel (hurray), nothing synthetic, it is just very charming and comforting. This really is like a lovely, very long lasting (5-6 hours on me), lotion type smell. Highly recommend giving this a try!	positif
303	16536600	This is our most favorite fragrance from all of the fragrance that I own. I have a few bottles here at home (around less than 5? or around 5? I'm not really that much of a perfume person...) But this is me and Reinan's favorite of all.I got this from another MUAer from a successful MakeUpAlley swap. I swapped my Estee Lauder Sensuous with her because I find Estee Lauder's Sensuous' scent quite strong for my taste when it comes to fragrances. Maybe it's too flowery for me, whereas I am preferring a citrus scent when it comes to fragrances.I've been searching this perfume everywhere here in Hong Kong, but unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere. Why? I have no idea? Probably, Marc Jacobs decided to discontinued this fragrance. I just can't find it anywhere, that's one thing for sure.The first time I got to try this perfume was from one of my friend here in Hong Kong. And on that first time, I fell in love with it. I know that this fragrance from Marc Jacobs is also affordable, compare to other branded fragrances.This is going to be a staple for me, it stays the whole day also, when sprayed first thing in the morning. It has this very light citrus smell which I love about it the most.I would continue tracking down as much bottles as possible for my stock for this fragrance from Marc Jacobs.	positif
304	17078863	I have been wanting this fragrance for a long time now but it was just too much for a lower brand fragrance IMO. I am so excited to say, I walked into Ross's just at the right time! The lady had just put out the largest bottle of DOT for less than half the price at the high end department stores! I grabbed it! My birthday is coming up fast and this is perfect for me. I do enjoy this fragrance. It is not a smell that I would wear every day but it is very fresh and lovely. The bottle is beautiful and I lusted for it I think more than I actually wanted the fragrance. ;-) I have not opened my bottle yet but I will just to make sure it is a good bottle as sometimes Ross has older scents and I have gotten bottles before that have leaked out. I do not expect this to be true of this fragrance though. I can't really describe this scent as it changes the whole time I am wearing it. It last a very long time with me. I kept getting samples of this perfume before I made my purchase. I was saving up for the large bottle when I came upon this one yesterday! I love wearing a new scent to bed at night so I can see how long it last and what it smells like the next morning. This is one of the scents that I tired that lasted way into the morning and still smelled great. I think it gets better the longer I wear it.	positif
305	1326222	I am an absolute sucker for perfume (I normally have at least 3 on the go at a time as I get bored of the scents easily!). I have two perfumes I can't live without and thats Hugo Boss Deep Red & JPG Classique.Well that's now changed.When I received the perfume I immediately noticed its lovely bottle design; it makes it very easy to hold and spray where you want it. When sprayed, it has a gorgeous scent. I sprayed without reading the box, and immediately I could pick up peach. It's a gorgeous smell! Its not too sweet either. I wore it to work one day and my colleague immediately picked up I smelled different! Its a fragrance that I think can be for every day and also occasional usage; its very versatile. I personally have dropped my JPG Classique for this one going forward as I prefer it!Strangely after the first spray I read the back and picked up its seductive content. About two minutes later my other half popped his head round the door and asked what the smell was. I tols him it was my new perfume and he nodded and said 'Smells nice darlin'. Thats the first compliment I've had off him in MONTHS!All in all I cannot recommend this perfume enough. It is also very reasonably priced and the scent lasts a long time even with only one spray. Buy it!! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
306	1355577	Before even opening the box for Dolce&Gabbana Light Blue the first thing that sprang to mind was Summer. The velvety soft blue box screams 'clear, bright, sunny skys'. The simply designed frosted bottle inside was pleasing on the eye (I often find some perfume bottles overtly fancy and a bit over the top).I applied it once after getting ready during the morning. The smell is gorgeous! Fresh, fruity and floral all rolled into one. When choosing perfumes I tend to go for ones with a distinct smell and this ticked all of the boxes.I received numerous compliments on it from work colleagues. I often find with some eau de toilette that their scent gets lost as the day progresses and fades away meaning reapplication. However this was not the case with Dolce&Gabbana Light Blue.......I still received a lovely comment on it late on in the afternoon (winner).I generally like to switch up my perfumes come the evening if heading out but the smell on this one is so perfect for the summer days yet it also has a sophiscated note about it that made me feel good about wearing it through into the evening.Absolutely will be buying this again. A five star scent for any woman wanting a versatile, sophisticated perfect Summer fragrance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
307	6248195	The smell of this perfume is lovely, it has a light woody scent that is subtle enough that you can wear this for both day and night. It is a nice soft smell, possibly a slight vanilla scent. As this is a parfum I only needed a small amount for it to last well in to the evening. The design of the bottle (a Marc Jacobs handbag) is very stylish, the sort of bottle you'd be proud to pull out in front of friends! The packaging of the perfume is very high quality too, right down to the smallest detail. The box has a velvet finish and beautiful gold embossed lettering. Upon opening the box the lid has been carefully packaged separately to the bottle. The lid is carefully wrapped in black tissue paper and then placed in a little box to protect the shiny gold chain handle I would imagine. The gold chain is metal and runs right through the lid, a nice design feature I thought. My only small gripe is that when you put the lid (the top of the handbag) on top of the bottle it then doesn't fit inside the box, the box won't close. It's such a lovely velvet box and I like to protect my perfume from any light to ensure the fragrance isn't effected. I also like to display my perfumes so I guess I just have to take the lid off whilst storing it in the box. This perfume has certainly made it on to my top 5 and I won't hesitate to buy this as a gift for my notoriously picky Mum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	positif
308	5411869	"Oh my, this is a tough one for me to review. When I first bought this, I really loved the smell. To me, it has a very cool vintage yet modern appeal about it imo. Sexy but not overtly sexy, sophisticated but not snobbish, if that makes sense. This does last on me all day and the dry down for me is pretty much the same as when first sprayed when I first bought this. I would caution to go lightly with this one if you are going to be around a lot of people (or any people?), as this to me seems to be one of those scents that can easily bother someone's nose or allergies or some of the notes can be headache-inducing. In fact, for some reason, after owning this for a few (3?) months, it induces headaches for me, whereas when I first bought it, I swooned over it. It also has a more cloying smell after having it for a few months. Bought from Ulta.com, so I know it is authentic and not old.. Anyway, back to the review.I have read some reviewers describe this as heavy on the rose scent, and I do not pick up on a heavy rose scent, which surprises me, because usually I typically do not like heavy rose scents. However, I can barely detect a rose scent in the background, but it mixes with other scents to put off a complimentary tone/scent, not overly floral. This to me is sophisticated and that has the ability to make you feel confident.I think this is a pretty bold perfume, not for shy types. The notes from the Lauder site say:BULGARIAN ROSEROSE CENTIFOLIA FIRABSRASPBERRYBOURGEON DE CASSISPINK PEPPERSAFFRONVANILLA MADAGASCAR SFEPATCHOULIVETIVERJASMINE PAYS FIRABSMAGNOLIA Again, I am shocked that rose is listed as the two top main accords, as I am not a fan of rose-scents, and yet I do love this and to me it is not the traditional rose scent, or at least it is mixed well with the other notes to compliment the notes nicely. To me this is a fairly unique perfume and a little 'different' that I appreciate it in a world where it seems so many scents are too girly or overly sweet. To me this is definitely a ""grown up"" perfume. I almost gave this a full five stars, however, I had to take a lippie off because of the price. Hear me out on this..I feel this is a hefty price tag for a Lauder perfume..So while I enjoy this well enough, and yes it does last all day for me, I feel it is pricey, this is getting up there with the high end perfumes, and I just don't see how Lauder can justify the cost. This also would have been a re-purchase, but again, because of the cost, I will just enjoy this as a treat this time. There are other scents out there that I like just as well, and not the hefty price tag. This is even more than two of my all-time favorite perfumes, Coach and Michael Kors. And to me this perfume just does not merit the hefty price tag. I hate bringing up price points, but when it factors into whether or not you would re-purchase, I feel the need to point it out. So I still kind of like this perfume, but won't re-purchase simply because of what I feel is an overpriced price point and also due to the quickly changing scent after owning it for a few short months. Plus there are other fragrances out there that I would rather have or try as opposed to repurchasing this. I liked this very well when brand-new, but imo a fragrance of this price point should not 'change' within a few short months, and seemingly so drastically. FWIW, I store my fragrances in their original boxes in a cool dark closet."	positif
309	4802429	good value, travel-friendly. I'm Totally loving this tender romance scent from ralph lauren fragrances. This is the perfect soft scent and the epitome of femininity. I wore this scent all day and let me just say that after sweating in the gym, the scent was still there and didn't have that weird sweat/perfume mixture scent that's stomach turning. This is a great scent for those who love to embrace their feminine side but don't want to be extra bold with fragrances that enters a room 15 minutes before they do. I highly recommend this scent. I did receive this free for review purposes but I can assure you that these opinions are all mine and are totally not influenced by anything other than the truth.	positif

347	5404348	Pleasantly surprised!! This is really nice!! I am embarrassed on how or why I went 'looking' for this fragrance. I had seen an old Live with Kelly and Michael episode where Richie Sambora (formerly of Bon Jovi) was on, and Kelly said how he smelled good and asked what he was wearing, and this is what he said.. So, I did some research, and it looked like the female version is just as nice as the man's version (I will review the man's version later; we got both versions!! :) ). I am such a layman with scents and fragrances, so here are the 'main accords' as listed on fragrantica.com: MAIN ACCORDS:citruswhite floralwoodysweetanimalicyellow floralAnd the notes, as listed on Fragrancex.com: pelargonium, ylang-ylang, tuberose, daffodil, orange blossom from morocco and jasmin, civet, benzoin, woody notes, tonka bean, indian vanilla, oakmoss, ambergris and musk. I am not familiar with many of those notes, and interestingly enough, fragrantica has apricot listed as one of the top main notes. So, the two websites seem to have some conflicting fragrance notes. But as a layman, the first thing to me about this is, this is different!! In a good way!! I realize fragrance is so personal, so take that into consideration. But for me, this is a slightly sophisticated scent without being too obnoxious (if you know what I mean, to me some 'sophisticated' scents are just obnoxious). This reminds me of something a classy aunt would wear. Thinking this is great for 30-something, 40-somethings, that general age range. Although obviously any woman of any age may or may not like this. Fragrantica has this listed as better suited for Fall and Winter, not really good for Spring or Summer, but I disagree, I actually think this is nice for Spring and Summer. So, to me, that makes this a great year-round scent. I also think this can go from day to night, and if used light-handedly, can be safe for the workplace, provided you do not work with anyone with allergies, asthma or a sensitive nose. That is not to say this is heavy, it is not, it is actually light considering all of the notes. And while many fragrance sites list citrus as main notes in this, to me this is a floral musky perfume. I detect a very faint, VERY FAINT, citrus note WAY IN THE BACKGROUND, but, to me, this is best described as a floral musky perfume. And that is even sprayed on a test paper, not interacting on the body. Although when I apply perfume, I spray and 'walk into' the spray, so it does not interact with body chemistry as much.The dry down on this for me is pretty much the same as when first applied, so that is a pleasant surprise. It is slightly sexy but mainly just sophisticated and even clean-smelling and well..just plain pretty. I feel this is a unique scent. And in a world where it seems there are so many overly sweet fragrances, and many scents seem geared for young girls, this is a nice change of pace. I like that this is not overly feminine, if that makes sense. This very closely borders on unisex, but the floral draws it into woman-scent. The bottle design itself I am not the biggest fan of from a woman's perfume perspective, but it is okay... What is inside is what matters to me more, anyway. And I am not one to buy a perfume 'because of the bottle'. ;) Very pleased and pleasantly surprised by this. I always get compliments when I wear this. Thinking this just may become my new signature scent. Although I do love my MK perfume and the original Coach perfume!! But, again, this is a very nice change of pace!! Will definitely repurchase!!	positif
348	5403801	Just in time for Valentines day (yeah, i know...it was a few months ago) there is a brand new, rose tinged Dolce and Gabbana fragrance - a gentle yet bright floral scent that is both classic and romantic. Forget a dozen long-stemmed roses, this year every girl in the know will be wishing for a bottle of Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce Rosa Excelsa Eau de Parfum. Much like past editions of the Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce franchise, Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce Rosa Excelsa Eau de Parfum is beautifully presented and in a similar manner too. Back once again is a timeless, frosted glass bottle finished off with a black bow and a delicate red rose cap. It is whimsical, fun yet not at all cheesy - this is a bottle you will display with pride. Now for the actual fragrance, as you have most likely guessed Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce Rosa Excelsa Eau de Parfum does of course feature more than a hint of rose. Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce Rosa Excelsa Eau de Parfum has been created to capture the freshness and pure spirit of a rose in bloom; this is achieved by blending two rose notes. For the first time ever in the world of perfumery, African Dog Rose is relied upon, for depth and richness this is combined with the delicate Turkish Rose Absolute. To prevent the scent from being too rose based, Rose Excelsa contains light, bright and white floral notes of: Neroli leaves and Papaya flowers, White Water Lily and White Daffodil, with a seductive kick of Sandalwood at the base to promote wear length. I must stress that unlike other rose fragrances Dolce and Gabbana, Dolce Rosa Excelsa Eau de Parfum, this is fresh and not at all powdery. It is classic yet youthful and should appeal to most ages and tastes for that matter - in my opinion it is the perfect Spring scent; it reminds me a lot of dew and Spring bouquets. Think of this as a rose tinged version of the original Dolce fragrance and you won't go far wrong. Also, the commercial the goes along with the ad is enchanting....search for it on youtube and i think you will agree and Sophia Loren could not have been a better face for the advertising as well. To my nose this smells just like rose water. A delicate whisper of something as beautiful as Repunzel with her long beautiful hair.	positif
349	4862486	Short version: NOT AN ANTIPERSPIRANT - you still sweat, will help cope with odour in a healthy way. Smell great, excellent scents/variety, sport version rocks too, mini size is perfect on the go. I have tried all of the scents of this deodorant.They have a mild, powdery slightly cornstarch scent to them underlying the base fragrance. The texture can be a little dry - I find if the air is dry/cold it will slightly firm up which can lead to skin tugging. The trick I've developed for this is to apply a light layer of body oil to my armpits (when I moisturize the rest of me), allow it to set into my skin, then apply the deo. This prevents the tugging that can occur. This is also a good trick for shaving days, as I have sensitive skin which can get irritated when I shave - moisturizing first can help with the bumps I get (always - not just in response to the deo). I love the minis - perfect for throwing in your bag to take with you. I sweat a lot, and I bring baby wipes and deo with me everywhere to clean up/reapply otherwise I stain my clothes - perfect for this purpose. Regarding scents:Vanilla Coconut - my absolute favourite, sweet creamy and totally dreamy without going insanely tropical.Vanilla Summer - lightly fruity/coconuty in a more tropical way, but perfect for summer in strapless dress (limited edition so get it quickly - body butter in this scent is on the Lavanila website).Pure Vanilla - a more powdery vanilla than a creamy vanilla - think sugar cookie rather than French VanillaVanilla Lemon - this one errs on the more masculine side, with a little bit of a soft vanilla/lemon cologne quality. Still wearable for a girl but the most masculine of the scentsVanilla Lavender - a soft powdery lavender, reminiscent of a mild scented bath soakVanilla Grapefruit - not as sharp/citrusy as I expected - more of a grapefruit cream than a true grapefruit but still soft and prettyVanilla Snowberry - a very powdery soft fruit scent - like a milder vanilla grapefruit (special edition winter fragrance). Sephora just released a four pack of the Lavender, Grapefruit, Coconut and Lemon fragrances in mini/travel sizes (very good value) - I highly recommend them, for gifting, personal use, trying the fragrances, travel, anything. On the Lavanila website you can also purchase Vanilla Passionfruit and Vanilla Blackberry fragrances in the deodorant and body butter. They also have gift sets of their perfumes, two types of sunscreen, and bath products. I've also tried the Sport version - the texture is preferable for sensitive skin, smoother application and no tugging and the fragrance is a bright sporty smell (not too masculine nor too feminine). For sweaty days this is definitely my preference, but for normal activity levels the standard cornstarch formulation works for me.	positif
350	4860291	good value, travel-friendly. I'll preface this by saying I am not a scent wearer. I'm very asthmatic with bad allergies so I have to be very careful. Generally anything that is heavily in florals (especially jasmine and honeysuckle), or has patchouli, and I'm breaking out in hives and having an asthma attack. So when I got the Orange Sanguine sample in my Sephora Play! box last month, I tossed it back in the shipping box to go to the trash. For some reason when I picked up the box to take it out, I decided to open the vial first. Am I ever glad I did! The orange is slightly sweet, but not at all cloying. It has a fresh and vibrant smell. I don't know what other scents it's mixed with, but there are definitely other things that come through. They soften the orange a bit, without creating a perfumey smell. I've been wearing this for a couple of weeks now and no asthma or hives. After I tried the orange sanguine, I decided to try this citrus sampler box. I'm a sucker for citrus. So far, in addition to the orange, I've tried the Pomelo. I only wore it once and need to try it again. It was slightly brighter and sweeter than the orange. It wasn't as complex as the orange for me, and I like the complexity. But It's my second favorite, and I think could become my first favorite upon further review. I've also tried the Bergamot. I was very disappointed by it, for my use. The scent is overall too strong compared to the orange or the pomelo. And Bergamot is one of my favorite citrus smells, so I expected it to be a favorite. I get some Bergamot when I first apply it, but the Bergamot fades behind a much richer base. Not being a perfume person I don't know what it is. It's not unpleasant, just too much for me, and perhaps a bit too masculine. I may see how this works out for my husband, because I don't dislike the scent, I just dislike it for me. Still haven't tried the Cedrat. Maybe tomorrow! Overall this box was a great value, even knowing I so far only love 2 out of 3 tried. I live in a smallish market, so our only Sephora is inside JCPenney. They don't have as many options, so probably don't carry these fragrances to sample. This was a great way to try them, and I feel like I got my money's worth.	positif
351	1403150	I'm always a bit picky with perfumes as heady scents really stick to my chest and make it difficult for me to breathe. For this reason I tend to stick to light perfumes with a citrus hint- something that clears my senses. Additionally I find it difficult when reading reviews- we've all got such different tastes that just because someone else loves a scent, it really has no bearing on whether you will. Now I've read that I'm not meant to mention other brands, but truth be told, in any review, I would do so. Just saying other perfumes isn't enough for me. I'm analytical and if I want to know if I like something, I'm far more likely to pay attention to something if it references other fragrances I'm familiar with. I want honest and complete. So as a way of calibrating, here are some of the scents that I love- Elie Saab, Valentino, NYC212 original and DKNY Be Delicious..these are ones I like to wear. When I read that GUCCI Bamboo was a woody scent, I was a little apprehensive, woody means JOOP and other 'amber' smells to me. But I'malso up for trying new things and new smells. The nose is honest!! I've had to wait until today before collecting my package and I pulled it out of the box in excitement (this is my first BA review!) The first thing that struck me was the pretty pastel pink box it comes in. The lid is designed to look like a bamboo stalk and the bottle is an interesting shape (I quite like to keep my empty bottles so this has some bearing on me!) . I spritzed a little on and was amazed at how light a fragrance this is. It's beautifully floral, perhaps a girl's scent or an older woman. It whispers grace and elegance. Definitely a smell for summer, reminiscent of all fresco dining and summer blossoms. It's a very pink smell; for floaty dresses and post beach day dinners. It evokes in me a memory of France and of being 14 (ouch! Yet wonderfully rejuvenating!). There's definitely a familiar smell in there of something I wore when I was younger (I'm yet to put my finger on what exactly), alongside ParmaViolets and rose. I'm 32 and I would happily wear this at any time of day. My husband really doesn't do smells and his verdict was: summery, feminine without being overbearingly so.I think I may have found my new perfume!!

352	5400504	Lots of beach time growing up in New England, and lived on the beach in FL for 16 years. I've spent so many days lazing in the sand, with nothing better to do than tan, and smell the lovely people of the beach. Sweat, salt, hot sand, hot skin, and sunscreen. It's typical in Destin to roll right from a day on the water to late afternoon cocktails at a local beach bar, still with our bathing suits under our sundresses, sand in our toes, and still reeking of sunscreen and salt, not giving a shit and just enjoying the laid back southern summer sunset. I got Bronze Goddess blind hoping it would capture it for me. It didn't. It's too coconutty/gourmand/musky. Think Hawaiian Tropic. I bought Beach and it is IT for me. It's fresh, salty, sun-creamy, oceanic with a spritz of jasmine. To me it's a niche fragrance in the respect that it's not a typical 'way' people want to smell. It's not sexy, not overtly feminine, it's not dangerously avant garde and not a classic; it's a scent almost more than it is a perfume. But it is Nostalgic, with a capital N. A certain scent can be emotionally transportive and take a person back to past real life. Nothing evokes a memory like a scent. This is it, at least for me. I can almost hear laughter, seagulls, distant boomboxes, the thump of volleyballs hitting the hot sand, the lifeguard's shrill whistle, the soft crash of the waves. Have you ever noticed how all of these sounds blend together, fade out, and create the most peaceful auditory backdrop? They are the hazy sounds of life happening all around, as you relax and take a break from it. This is quintessentially the beach. I give it a 5 solely for capturing nostalgia, which makes it more than the sum of its parts. I really enjoy it. I have a rollerball, and it'll probably last me forever. I wear it for the experience, not as a daily fragrance. (In the spirit of objectivity, if you don't have memories associated with Coppertone, this may be nothing more than a benzoin(?), jasminey aquatic to you, possibly nothing special) I layer it with Bronze Goddess sometimes, different but very interesting.	positif
353	6073853	I love fragrances, always have, I used to work in cosmetics & had the opportunity to work for lines that had very famous scents which I loved. I was surrounded by fragrance & amassed quite a few different favorites. Fast forward 5 years, I'm still in the industry & am working as a fragrance model, obviously, the amount of scent I own is bordering the ridiculous. I thought I had my ride or die faves chosen...I was so wrong. About 2 years ago I open a magazine I received in the mail, there's a scent strip for Jour de Hermes Absolu. It was love at 1st sniff! The following month was Christmas so I tore out the entire page & handed it to my husband with the decree, I WANT THIS. Like the amazing man he is, he marched into every department store in town until he hit Sephora & thus, the jackpot. Bought it & had it wrapped up nice & neat in less than 2-3 days. I've been wearing it daily ever since & cannot tell you how many compliments I get when I do. It's a scent that transcends winter & summer, wearing well all year long. It smells just as perfect in the heat of July when I'm wearing flip flops as it does when I'm wrapped up in a warm fuzzy scarf imbued in its fragrance. I had a friend wear a scarf of mine one cold December day, smell Jour de Hermes Absolu & IMMEDIATELY ask me, WHAT perfume are you wearing?!?! I wanted Sephora to carry the larger bottle for purchase, until I noticed that the Hermes bottle is refillable!!! Just grasp the spray top & twist left, comes off easily. It's written on the box that it's refillable, but it's surprising how few people know this fact. I found the refill online, pity I couldn't buy it from Sephora, but they don't carry it or I would buy it from here. (~HINT~HINT~ people...) Until I can buy the refill here, I'll just continue filling my original 1.6oz bottle from Sephora with my refill. If you love this, email Sephora and ask them to SELL THE REFILL. It comes in a 4.2 oz size glass bottle with a pointed funnel tip that makes refilling easier than you'd think. If you love this fragrance like I do, check it out, because you can refill it, so start doing that. And pestering Sephora to carry the refill, I'd much rather give them my money. Until then, I do what I gotta do, I have too, it's the only fragrance I ever wear anymore, I love it so much!!!	positif
354	5413070	"Can't put this down. Im glad I am not the only one that sees a resemblance between this and Stella. Im surprised this is called ""midnight rose"" bc it's actually fresh and daytime appropriate to my nose-- this is actually my day to day scent. I love roses and this fragrance is so comforting to me, while also smelling polished and very feminine. This perfume reminds me of Stella and also ysl Parisienne. The Stella edp and myself never clicked-- with Stella I got a super tea-rose type smell in the top notes. Tea smell isn't my favorite as a skin scent. Stella gave me this astringent vibe that I didn't care for and it made it difficult to stick with it to the drydown. I actually love the drydown and use the lotion from time to time bc it gets me from point a to point b faster. Midnight Rose reminds me of that Stella drydown-- roses, a teeny amount of pink pepper, and a dry woodsy, non sweet vanilla. It also reminds me of Parisienne but without all the sandlewood. It's like a love child of the two. Parisienne on top and more Stella like as it wears on. At any rate I love this and I am so cozy and at home in this fragrance. It lasts all day as well- no small feat bc my skin eats some rose fragrances (side eyes roses de Chloe). Only 4 stars bc I bought this a month ago, but if im still this obsessed in a few months I will def bump it to 5!Also crossing my fingers it doesn't get dc :(( as flankers tend to do. Lancome please don't do it! As far as perfumes go- this is actualy a pretty affordable one. So I don't feel wasteful using it every day"	positif
355	6249051	This was my first experience with Chloe perfume, of any type, so I didn't have any expections prior to using the product. Before buying this product I would consider who you are buying for. In this instance I think that Chloe has covered all of their bases with this fragrance as I thoroughly enjoyed this product and was complemented by my 50+ mum and 75+ grandma. Although I think the product itself would appeal to a broad spectrum of woman, the branding of Chloe does seems to have a more youthful side to it whichs emphaising a sense of occasion. I'd also consider the power of the fragrance you are looking for. With this perfume I found it to be a delicate scent that was fairly durable across the day. So if it's longevity and freshness you are looking for...look no further! My first impressions where extremely positive. A clearly branded and simple design to the box and the bottle itself has a gatsby-esque design which suggests an air of luxury and elegance. Tied with a simple bow in neutral tones, the visual appeal was there from the start. I used the spray at the wrist and neckline the first time I used it and was impressed by the delicate floral notes which didn't overpower me, feel artificial or have that old fashioned smell. Personally I am an infrequent perfume user - extremely forgetful when it comes to applying a scent - but in this instance I've found myself wanting to wear it; almost insisting I didn't forget. As with all perfumes re-application is necessary if you want to smell floral and fresh all day and night, however, on the occassions where I didn't reapply would could still get a hint of the undertones on my skin and clothing which was enjoyable.

356	25331266	This is absolutely lovely - a beautiful perfume Beautiful fragrance - my absolute favourite Juliette has a gun fragrance - just so pretty. First off the bat it is a fruity floral but it’s anything but average it’s just so skillfully blended - bursting with red fruit and realistic rose that is fresh sweet and a little creamy without being TOO sweet or in any way cloying. I also really like Anyways and Gentlewoman by these guys but I have the softest spot for this one. It’s just so pretty and yummy and elegant. It’s not gimmicky or offensive smelling and it’s not trying to hard to be interesting - while I love to smell interesting perfumes as a scent experience they don’t always end up being things I would like to wear. This is something I would wear every day and never tire of it (by which I mean that this is my rotation of about 6 perfumes I wear all the time) - I have about 45 perfumes in my collection but there are the 5-6 that are my signature scents. This is tasteful enough to be worn anywhere it has great lasting power and decent sillage but it’s not offensive. I can honestly say that this is in my top 1-2 fruity floral. I DK why some people think fruity florals are overdone I mean fruit and flowers are a great combination and they are among the best scents nature produces - this strikes me as high quality it’s simple yet has that kind of fullness that I associate with quality scent. It takes great skill, I think, to take scents that are universally loved like rose and berries and make something original and natural and beautiful that no one’s done before and JHAG has done it here. Perfectly blended and unique. If you’re a big fan of this brand’s best selling perfume - “Not a Perfume” - well you may or may not know that the other perfumes in this line are perfumes in the sense that they include several notes as opposed to one single aromachemical. This scents has a few different notes but it’s no more complex than it needs to be to be whole and a perfect composition.	positif
357	4711794	good value, travel-friendly, reusable. I got a sample of Mad Madam a while back and I've been itching to see what the rest of this line is like since then. This kit is a great way to see what they've got. I do wish that it included all of the fragrances in the line, but 8 is pretty good.Not a Perfume: In my opinion, this one is not very interesting. I don't really have anything to say about it except 'meh.'Anyway: I like this one. It's a very pleasant light scent that doesn't trip into powderyness. It does fade a little quickly, though.Gentlewoman: I liked this one in the vial, but less on my skin. I found it too sweet smelling. The almond was a bit too strong.Miss Charming: This is a bright, youthful, floral scent. At first it was kind of annoyingly young smelling like so many ill-advised trendy perfumes are, but as it dried down it got much more complex and interesting.Romantina: At first, this one smelled very modern, a little fruity, and maybe a little dusty. As it developed, I found it smelling a bit like a baby's diaper. Too much musk for me. Even with that, though, as the day went on I found it to be a bit on the compellingly gross side. Ew, let me smell that again.Mad Madame: The one that sparked my interest in the first place is still my favorite! This is a very dark kind of floral. I think it's perfect for doing floral in the winter.Lady Vengeance: I find this one to be pretty similar to Mad Madam, but it's a bit more mellow, less sharp.Midnight Oud: It's kind of a woody oriental fragrance with an incense-y quality and a sort of pleasant dustyness.All in all a great kit, though it would be even better if it gave us a chance to try Citizen Queen, Calamity J, Vengeance Extrême, White Spirit, Another Oud, Oil Fiction, and Moondance as well. Perhaps there should be a second kit.	positif
358	23023597	"I have EXTREMELY dry skin. I have since I was really young too! When I'm telling you I've tried them all, take my word for it!!! I have spent SO much money on moisturizers over the years, but Belif's moisturizing bomb is really the best of the lot!! It's SO hydrating, that I can only use it in the cold weather months. (Don't confuse this with their aqua bomb, which is a gel cream-- I can only use that in the summer-- otherwise it's WAY too drying!!) I am also the most sensitive person in the WORLD to smells and perfumed products. (For instance, people rave about Tarte's ""shape tape,"" but the strong perfume scent put me off so much I can't use it!) So I'm SHOCKED people take issue with THIS moisturizer's smell, when no fragrance or perfume is added!! If anything it has a slight HERBAL scent-- not flowers, not citrus-- herbal. And it goes away quickly after putting it on-- doesn't linger at all! But more importantly, nothing works better than this moisturizer when it comes to deeply PENETRATING the skin. So many moisturizers I've tried, even rich cream ones, don't do this. Instead they just sit on top. So this moisturizer is very unique in this way and worth every penny! I will NEVER be without this in the fall or winter again. And the price is pretty reasonable considering you need so little of it to work! The smaller .84 ounce size lasts me about 1-2 months, and the larger 1.68 oz size last several months!! I love the kits Sephora offers too-- get them!! You really get so much value for the money... I love to layer this cream with Belif's water essence serum to REALLY lock in the moisture too! I'm telling you, if you have super dry skin, this combination WORKS!!"	positif
359	5246231	One word: PATCHOULIThe patchouli is what I love most about this. I did not like Flowerbomb at first. I sampled it for YEARS and every time I said, It's too girly and too feminine. I couldn't possibly pull this off! Then I bought it and hated the longevity (two hours tops). But I loved the sweetness of it.Then today... I had an epiphany: the silage on my skin is awful, as in I can't smell it on my neck, and I can only smell the top and middle notes on myself if I spray it on my neck, but it *lasts* for over 12 hours. How do I know this? Because I sprayed it on my wrists and could not stop smelling them all day long. I am now in love with this scent. It is the scent of a goddess. A gift from the genius of Viktor&Rolf.Let me explain why I love this so much: those top notes are incredibly sweet and are a delight to experience from the get-go. The middle notes keep me intrigued. BUT, those base notes... oh my lord. Musk and patchouli. My favourite base notes ever. And the way they stick to my skin is just lovely. This is a close-encounter fragrance for me. Others can smell it on me from a mile away, yet somehow I cannot! So when I sprayed it on my wrists today, as opposed to my neck, I noticed an uncanny difference. I just kept thinking patchouli patchouli patchouli. Oh my how I love it. Personally, this fragrance took a while for me to figure out in terms of how many sprays I need for it to last and *where* I need to be spraying it on my skin for me to enjoy it all day. Wrists for myself to smell, and neck for others to smell from afar. BOTTOM LINE: the most soft, feminine, and youthful fragrance of all time. Thank you, perfumers of Viktor&Rolf, for your timeless creation.	positif
360	5404647	"My 3.4oz bottle says ""Prescriptives Calyx"" on the bottom, and I bought it a few years ago from an online etailer. Maybe I got one of the last of the Prescriptives available?Anyway, I'm not generally a big fan of fruity scents, but this one is so very fresh and nice -- without being piercing in any way. It's *not sharp*, thank heavens, like some other uber-citruses can be -- it's just very juicy, soft, and almost drinkable.Smells like a melon+orange+lime sorbet to me -- like sweet honeydew -- but it's actually a complex fruity-floral, with lily. When I smell it on my skin later, I don't think ""fruit"" -- it has mellowed and musked down into a very pretty, rather shampoo-y-smelling skin scent. Almost more like a body wash or shampoo than a perfume you've sprayed on. Definitely a happy scent, very uplifting, unobtrusive to the public. Again -- it's *not sharp* (I hate sharpness) -- soft & mellow -- a very pretty fruity-floral sorbet. Really nice!The original Prescriptives formula launched in 1986 (was bought out by Clinique & now available at Clinique counters), and its notes, per parfumo.net are:Top Notes - Apricot, Bergamot, Spearmint, Peach, TagetesHeart Notes - Cyclamen, Jasmine, Lily, Lily-of-the-valley, Melon, RoseBase Notes - Raspberry, Moss, Musk, CedarCalyx is delicious -- especially refreshing in warm summer weather! Although the following are more apple-based, I feel that others in the same overall fresh-fruity softly shampoo-ish fragrance family are See by Chloe or Ralph by Ralph Lauren (turquoise striped bottle)."	positif
361	10536343	Initially, whenever I hear of Chanel No 5 from my lola, I get prejudicial about my lola’s taste in fragrance. I tell her Chanel No 5 is for old people and smells awfully strong. But the truth is, I never even sniffed or whiffed that perfume before. Only in stories. After browsing around Rustan’s Essences in Shangri-la Mall (Shaw) for a new signature scent (My old favorite: Narcisso Rodriguez EDP) I finally got the courage to try Chanel perfumes. I sprayed on my wrist.*sniff sniff*Surprise! It smells like a combinatation of baby powder, flowers, mild sweetness and sophistication.But why?As I always say, perfume pulses a different fragrance, depending on you skin chemistry so ALWAYS TEST! (An original tester! Lots of fakes everywhere). I resent the labeling of No. 5 as “Old Lady” perfume. I had heard it labeled as such for most of my life, that I assumed it was true. No modern woman of my generation would wear such.Not every woman is fit for this perfume, and it definitely has a sense of maturity to it. This woman was the right fit, always elegant, not vain or slovenly, she had what was truly grace. She always had men around her because they realized that she was of an uncommon stock and refinement. If so many “old ladies” wear this perfume, I imagine it is because they realize the raw potential it has, its ineffable force that can ensnare a man’s soul like mine was so effortlessly. 50 years from now, when I am old and gray, I know that this scent will still captivate me, returning me to that moment, if only for an instant.

362	5413577	This was such a yummy yet unnecessary splurge for me. I would advise anyone that isn't absolutely dying to own it, to wait until it lowers in price. It smells so damn good, yet, it smells so similar to so many other pink, rosey, less expensive fragrances...of which I own many. In particular this smells similar to my Viva La Juicy La La Malibu...and nearly identical to my Perry Ellis 360 Pink. Recently I lined up my 10 favourite perfumes out of my extensive, obsessive, slightly creepy hoard of fragrances....they all have pink bottles or caps-to give you an idea of my taste in scents. Anyway I love this, I have been waiting since last winter to buy it. Smelling it, stalking it, drooling over it, and waiting for it to drop in price....which it hasn't yet. So when I saw it in a gift set with the 50 ml perfume plus rollerball I couldn't wait any longer. When the saleslady asked if it was a gift I lied and said yes since the amount of perfume I buy is embarrassing-haha! I'm sure these gift sets will probably be half price at WalMart after Christmas. Anyway onto the scent itself....pretty simple...a soft rose and juicy pear. That's pretty much all I smell. A definite floral/fruity pink smell. It's soft, pretty, and cheerful. Sits pretty close to the skin. Good every day or signature scent. Pretty sparkly bottle. But unless you are like me-obsessed with rose scents, and a collector of Juicy Couture fragrances...I wouldn't pay full price for this	positif
363	5399919	I am a little surprised at the low reviews on this, but fragrance is so personal. To me, this is wonderful clean, fresh, modern, slightly edgy, slightly sophisticated, if you like or liked CK One that was so popular back in the early 90's, you might like this. I spray 2 sprays and 'walk' into this (as I do with pretty much all spray fragrances). This lasts on me all day, 12 hours or more, and for me, the dry down is pretty much the same as when first sprayed. Also, much like CK One, I think this can easily be a unisex scent. I am not a fan of masculine-smelling perfumes (some may know what I mean!! lol), but I do like this.. Not saying this is masculine smelling, not at all!!!, but very much a unisex scent, imho.I am a greenhorn with notes, but I do see two notes and accords from different websites: from Kohls website: FRAGRANCE NOTES:Neroli tunisia, fresh green pear, watery plum, gardenia petals, pink peppercorn, violet leaf, Texan cedarwood, vetiver, benzoin Laos orpur and musk. from Fragrantica website: MAIN ACCORDS:citrusfruitywhite floralsweetaquatic The notes in this surprise me somewhat, but they seem to work together nicely for me, imho....I also like the bottle, clean and classy looking. I am not a fan of frilly bottles. This is also easy to hold in the hands and easy to spray (which my aging, old bad wrists appreciate!!) Not sure I would re-purchase, though. I think I am happy to have this once and will be done with it once it is gone. But I am enjoying it greatly and it is perfect for me for the upcoming longer days of Spring and Summer. Clean, fresh and classy. That is what I think of when I think of this.	positif
364	4893925	Game-changer. This is my first experience with Juliette Has a Gun; I am a new convert. I'm obsessed. Not a Perfume takes some flack for being uncomplicated; while the fragrance itself may be one-note, it's very... intriguing? It's very clean and gender-neutral. I recently described it to a friend as very 1990s, Like CK1 but without the headache. But it doesn't actually smell like a perfume at all. It isn't powdery or stale. It just smells like warm, clean skin. (Just now I asked my husband how I smell. Good! he said. But *what* do I smell like? He thought for a long time. Nothing, he finally managed. To which I was like, Right??) It would be easy to mistake the scent for something more... pheromonal? I find it extremely sexy in a primal way. Which makes sense—it's like if you added a musky base note to your natural smell. On that: I use a lot of coconut- and almond-scented products daily (my deodorant and shampoo both have a lot of fragrance on their own), and this not-a-perfume layers really nicely, so that there aren't any competing scents. For someone who works in an office with coworkers, travels, or herself (or himself) is sensitive to fragrance, I think this is the ticket. Just don't tell anyone that your alluring new scent is synthetic ambergris, because they may, like my husband, already know what ambergris is. (Oh, you mean whale bile? Yes, I mean synthetic whale bile.) Don't let that scare you off, though. Turns out that stuff smells fantastic.	positif
365	5608010	feminine, subtle, pleasant. I have about 30 perfumes but NONE of them come remotely close to being my holy grail as much as The One (some come in at a distant second)To me, cologne and perfume are about evoking feelings, not just smells. None of my other perfumes make me feel like The One does. I feel, strong, professional, but surprisingly feminine and ethereal...like some kind of galactic high elf, if that makes sense... when i wear this. Basically, I feel like a woman who is actually adult-y (I'm told i don't look my age and my personality is a bit kooky)This is my most complimented fragrance by men. Women like it but I get complimented 3 or 4 times more by my male coworkers. Whether I'm wearing The One alone, or on top of another perfume, OR on top of a male fragrance, i ALWAYS receive at least one or two compliments on it. Although it's not the most unique scent, or the strongest in my collection, there's just something about the sweet subtlety in this scent that really captivates my guy friends/coworkers, and me as well. I read that fragrance is extremely personal, and based on what i smell on my own skin and what other people smell, I can safely say that this *luckily* works perfectly with my natural chemistry, which I'm so happy about.Most of my female coworkers splash on overly sweet or fruity scenes that stink up the break room for the first 2-5 minutes then completely disappear, and despite this, I'm the one who has become known for always smelling really good every day. I have no doubt that The One had a large chunk in that. Within a month or two of buying the smaller bottle, i went out and got the largest size as a back up. I know i will continue to wear this for a very, very long time.	positif
366	15948777	I'm obsessed with Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume.The best perfume ever !!!Recently, I purchased the Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau so Fresh Eau de Toilette spray. Ever since I first glanced upon it, I wanted it very much. I have been using it every day; its mellow scent allows me to wear it to class and not bother those around me. Personally, I use just one spray per day. My friends, on the other hand, like various different scents, such as strong earthy scents and provocative, citrus scents. If you like sweet and fruity, you should try the Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau so Fresh Eau de Toilette spray. Quite honestly, this is a type of fragrance made for all women. In addition, the perfume is a great purchase because of its inexpensive price, sweet smell, beautiful bottle design.Smell: This perfume’s scent is incredibly fresh and contains fruity notes of grapefruit, raspberry and pear. It also has floral notes of violet, rose, and apple blossom. In my opinion, it would be a great birthday present and/or holiday gift. Another similar product, the Marc Jacobs Daisy Dream, also has lovely cents and is contained in a very pretty bottle as well. If you’re feeling adventurous, you could perhaps give it a try!Packaging: the bottle cap is so pretty with all different colors of flowers. The cap’s flowers have 3D dimension flowers. This makes it impractical for travel. However, I love to decorate my room, so this perfume is great to put next to my other perfumes. If you are perfume collector you should the price is $90.00 The price is a really good deal to consider. Overall, I sincerely believe the Marc Jacobs Daisy Eau so Fresh Eau de Toilette spray is a great purchase. Marc Jacobs Daisy by Marc Jacobs 3.4oz 100ml EDT Spray	positif
367	24309959	I was first introduced to this scent when I was 16 years old for my then boyfriend’s prom. My father purchased it for me. Now I’m 23 years old and I still love this fragrance! This scent is as sexy as sexy can get. Men love it. I get asked all the time about my scent when I wear this scent from Armani. It never fails and it doesn’t matter who it is, male or female. I love to wear this scent when I dress up but it has such a pleasant smell that it can be worn casually as a work fragrance or what have you. I highly recommend this fragrance! It is worth every penny and a couple of sprays go a long way without being over powering or strong. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent!	positif
368	18840787	I love this fragrance for my everyday scent, to a special date night scent! It fits both occasions. I really enjoy the fragrance and I get many compliments every time I wear it. It lasts very long on my skin as well. A tip I love is to put on a scent free moisturizer before applying my perfume to make my scent last as long as possible. It's very fragrant but not over powering. I would describe it as a sweet scent, the notes are wild berries, jasmine and vanilla. It's actually an old favourite of mine I've been wearing since high school. I love that it is still a scent I can wear and I don't feel like I've out matured it. It's a great gift for women of all ages because of that.	positif
369	11441206	WOW! this fragrance smell so good and unique. The booze smell comes out on the initial spray but quickly evaporates. The scent is then followed by a sweet tobacco scent with a smoky dry down. Within 15-20 minutes the wood smell takes over the fragrance still leaving traces of sweet tobacco,cinnamon and an earthy scent in the background. Great for Fall or Winter due to the scent. The projection could be longer after 1 hour it became a skin scent. Within 4 hours it's barely detectable. I don't think the scent will hold up in extremely cold weather below 45°F. The fragrance will do better in a temperature controlled environment during fall season. It's a cheap fragrance around $30-40 for a 3.3 Oz online.	positif
370	933469	I really liked this. The scent is lovely and I am happy that the scent does fade. There is a small trace of scent but your skin just smells fresh. I prefer that as I love my perfumes. The crème itself is very moisturizing and non greasy. I was able to apply it and follow with putting jeans on not too long after. I really like this crème and will be using consistently moving forward.	positif
371	1633172	Draws Compliments,Long-Lasting,Sexy Too Expensive My husband loves it when I wear this perfume and I do to, it just mixes so well with my body chemistry.

372	16715144	If you're looking for a romantic evening scent, then I think this fragrance is ideal. It's a stronger scent that makes it a sexier date night perfume.

377	7824109	My boyfriend got me this perfume for our 2 year anniversary and I absolutely love it. It smells floral but not in an obnoxious way.

Th bottle is so pretty and it not only looks good on your vanity, but it smells good on your skin as well!	positif
378	7824283	This is a VERY popular scent and I am here to add to the hype. There are a few other scents that smell like this one such as La Vie Est Belle but this fragrance seems to last the longest on me. It's all floral scents but to me it smells more gourmand. LOL The scent is very sweet with a hint of sexy. You will definitely get compliments when wearing this scent. love it!	positif
379	7824522	By far, my fave fragrance. This has been my signature scent since it first launched in 2007. It mixes well with my chemistry and I can still smell it the next day.

384	18407899	I live this scent. My all time favorite scents ever are the beautiful/beautiful love perfumes, but this is at the top. It smelled nothing like those two.

385	10549925	Beautiful scent. This scent has been around a long while & I love it. I believe the fragrance has changed over the years due to regulations on ingredients, etc. I also believe that Dior either has discontinued or is thinking of discontinuing this scent. I have found it difficult to find in stores. The fragrance is light & floral. I would prefer the perfume as it would last longer on the skin.	positif
386	10553145	This is such a lovely perfume. The scent feels very sultry and sexy. It is my go to scent for the fall/winter months. To me it smells very warm and woodsy, with vanilla undertones.

387	10951603	My favorite scent of all time. The scent is classic and will never become old. I have used this scent for the past 5 years and have never gotten a bad comment about it.

388	11861333	I've been lusting after this perfume ever since I got a tester with a different makeup purchase - it's a bit out of my price range at the moment but the vanilla scent is delicious and it smells amazing for hours.

392	18407853	I love Dior perfume. Its feminine and flirty. This particular scent did not combine with my scent in a good way, it left me smelling like my mother and I didn't like that.

393	17859396	My mom own this perfume so I'm very used to the scent, it's pretty good and long lasting. It has a floral, fruity scent and it's also sweet. Very feminine scent. I would definitely recommend. If you're looking for a good quality fragrance, you will appreciate j'adore.<br>	positif

395	15663330	Has a wonderful smell. If I had to choose between this scent and Clinique Happy Heart, I would actually choose happy heart.

396	22797580	Because of allergies and my sensitive skin it’s been quite difficult to find fragrances that not only appeal to me but that my body can tolerate. I love this scent!!!

If you are looking for a scent that is light, slightly floral and has a long lasting scent then I wholeheartedly suggest Happy!	positif
397	7817952	Chanel Coco mademoiselle eau de parfum spray has always been my go to fragrance. The scent is very floral, and just smells good on me. People always ask me what scent I am wearing. Other scents do not compare to this one. I would recommend this scent to anyone who wants to smell very girly but not over girly.	positif
398	7818086	The best. This is such a beautiful scent that is so light and spicy. It has been my signature scent for ages. I'm not a big heavy fragrance fan, but this is lightly musky with hints of patchouli and rose. Chanel is classic and this scent is one of those ageless perfumes that I'll be able to wear for the rest of my life.	positif
399	10516635	This is arguably the best scent Chanel has ever made!! It has notes of musk, Jasmine, powder. The scent is elegant and sophisticated; it's a mix between floral and powder.

400	19614608	Smelled this at the perfume counter at Macy's and thought it smelled great. Its a more flowery scent which is a reflection of the new trend towards this sort of scent.

403	1139514	"Even though other reviews gave this five stars... After six cycles of chemotherapy, I have become sensitive to certain odd-fragrances. This ""Clean Comfort"" bar soap smelled pretty good in that package at a brick-and-mortar store, but upon opening and trying in the shower, the fragrance had changed, and left a lingering horrible chemical-scent, after-the-fact. Kind of like a bad after-taste. It also left a funny-feeling residue on my skin. I have returned it to Amazon and will go back to mild-scented Ivory Aloe."	negatif
404	5156905	I tend to adore all of Clinique's moisturizers.. I have purchased the dramatically different moisturizing gel over and over again. I also love the moisture surge. Yet, when I purchased this particular lotion, and I took a whiff, it smelled horrible..like a gas like chemical scent. I looked at the ingredients to figure out why this may be.. I saw that one of the main ingredients is MINERAL OIL. Why, Clinique, why? Their other products do not contain this. I cannot risk clogging my pores. Plus, I can't even use it on my body since the scent is putrid. I had to throw it out. $20 completely wasted.	negatif
405	18294561	i appreciated being a tester for this product from Loreal.&nbsp; The product was not for me for several reasons. The fragrance was very very strong- a powdery scent which is not for me. Besides the powder scent, also the product has a very chemical scent. Also, the product was very drying overly drying i would say. I do appreciate and like how Loreal is moving in the direction of more natural ingredients, if they could just go all natural and move towards natural essential oil infused scents as well. Just wasnt for me or my skin type- mature skin with normal to dry skin type and minor breakouts here and there	negatif
406	22679623	AVOID I bought this as a set with a body butter in the Japanese Rose scent. This shower gel is terribly drying and has a strange chemical scent that lingers after I shower. For a brand that claims to be natural and homeopathic (yikes), I was really surprised to see that the second ingredient in this product, after water, is Sodium Laureth Sulfate! Even drugstore body washes no longer use this ingredient because it is well known to be an overly harsh surfactant. Avoid this if you have dry skin, live in a dry climate, or generally don't want to have to overcompensate for the dryness of this shower gel with a greasy moisturizer after. I stuck with this shower gel for a few months so I could use it up, but I'm going back to my Shea Moisture body wash.	negatif
407	2506736	I purchased this item on Friday - fawn and dark cocoa. Having used the LA girl concealer for years I know what it's quality should be. This is not the real deal. It is an absolute fake. The dark cocoa first and foremost is half empty. It is actually just full of air. The consistency is very watery for both concealers. Now the most worrying bit is the very harsh chemical scent coming out of the tubes as soon as you open it. I cannot even attempt to put this on my face for fear of burning it off. If you value your face I suggest best not to buy from here. It might be cheap but is definitely not worth destroying my face.	negatif
408	1151915	I love Burt's Bees lip balm but this one was awful! The scent was terrible, I had to get rid of them because the smell made me sick to my stomach. I'm sure other people will like the scent but I don't...Sorry	negatif
409	5179289	I love Nars but this stuff was awful the scent is strong and after about two hours it would oxidize so badly that I would have to wipe it all off cause it looked so bad. If you have even the least bit of oily skin stay away. If you have dry skin this might work for you, might.	negatif
410	4853571	smell bad, greasy, short lasting. I was more than excited and can't wait to try it when I learned about this product. I bought it on another site in a sale, despise that I tried to avoid Lancôme. I've got boom meringue (don't know why Sephora website has changed all the names of the colors), first of all, it does NOT smell like the suggested flavor, nor any good flavor, it smells like chemically solvent, the texture is like an oil that doesn't absorb, the feeling is greasy and not hydrating, there is color, but no tint, it lasts like 15 minutes on lips without doing anything with lips. The packaging is big and bulky. I've swatched some other colors in stores, and noticed that many of them smell the same - chemically solvent smell, same greasy slippery texture, some deeper colors leave slight tints on hands. Overall, very disappointed.	negatif
411	6090103	I loved the original Saint scent and wore it for years. When I could no longer get my hands on it, I had given up all hope. So when I seen that it was being released again I was thrilled!! Looking at online reviews before being able to smell it in store myself, I found that many people were not impressed with the scent. The biggest complaint was that it did not smell like the original that was so loved. When I was in my local Sephora store I noticed they had a few displays out with testers of the fragrance. I crossed my fingers and tried a spritz, walked around the store and gave it a sniff. My heart instantly broke, it smelled nothing like the scent I had loved and worn for years. Maybe if you are new to the Saint scent you would really love it, but for those of us who have been lucky enough to have had the original this just fell short.	negatif
412	4707964	not worth the money, great that it is 100% natural, does not smell like vanilla. I purchased the full size in Vanilla. It works as a deodorant for me because I don't sweat a lot nor have bad odor when I do. I wanted to return it because of the smell...its not at all vanilla and more of a cheap men's shave cream smell. Also the Sephora I went to didn't even carry the product for me to exchange for a different scent. I started using it out of necessity and it does it job but fails miserably for a $14 deodorant that is so highly rated. It drives me nuts that the cap is twist off and to get more product you have to twist the bottom. I find it annoying every time I use it that I end up twisting both sides and have a huge stick of deodorant when I finally open the cap. I will not repurchase. The only good thing about this product is knowing that its 100% natural. Unfortunately, to pay $14 for a below par performing, highly rated product is a 100% UNNATURAL.	negatif

434	1469819	I use other products by CeraVe that I absolutely love so thought I would try this body wash. It’s horrible! I tried it twice and threw it out just because of the awful smell it has; even my husband commented on how bad it stinks. I also didn’t like how runny this body wash is.

436	5423399	I've read so many positive reviews by now that I think I must have done something wrong.. did I maybe leave it too long on my bathroom shelf so it became bad before I even touched it? To me, this wasn't enjoyable. The foam was not creamy but watery, so it didn't feel like I got my skin clean with this. The smell is awful, too.Pro: - cruelty free- organicCon:- awful smell- watery- skin doesn't feel as clean as with ofher cleansers	negatif
437	17089579	I liked the look of this but when I coloured my hair with it, it didn’t change the colour or cover my greys. It was easy to use and didn’t have that awful smell that a lot of others do but that’s of no importance if it doesn’t do the job it’s supposed to. I thought it was very overpriced and would not recommend it to anyone.	negatif
438	9826753	This is probably the worst mascara I've ever tried. It had this god awful smell from the moment I opened it, like toxic chemicals, which really concerned me. The formula is very dry and once it was on my lashes, they looked grey rather than black. My lashes ended up looking very clumpy. I used this three times before tossing it. The only thing I looked about this mascara was the smaller brush for the lower lashes.	negatif
439	24640454	"This is the most disgusting and worst idea for a perfume/colgone EVER in the history of perfume. It smells exactly like the title ""By the Fireplace."" You know that awful smell after you've been sitting around a fire pit that is embedded into your clothing and takes 3 days to wash out of your hair?? Yeah that is what it smells like. I can't believe someone even sat around a marketing table and suggested this scent and then other ppl actually said ""that's a great idea"" and they actually made it and sell it. TERRIBLE!"	negatif
440	5850059	I'm a big fan of Laura Mercier products but not this one. I don't wear foundation make-up every day, so that might have something to do with the problems I've had with this product.

441	22560447	If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. It has an AWFUL smell, taste, and coloring. Yes the packaging is cute/sturdy but glass, it's is not worth the price or benefits if I'm suppose to ingest it... that's not happening again. All of the reasons I listed above are super important to me when using a supplement type product and I truly believe there are WAY better alternatives for the benefits this has.	negatif
442	19722274	STRONG SMELL, no visible results I have been using it for 2 months now, I don't see any difference at all. Beware that it has a strong smell, I don't enjoy it, I think the smell is the worst part of it. I won't repurchase, I'm sure there are many serums that can give you real results, without the awful smell and for a much affordable price.	negatif
443	18920338	This product gives a similar effect to Becca's illuminating primer but this one smells HORRIBLE! The scent lingers for hours after you use it. I had to remove my whole face of makeup to try to get rid of the awful smell. It didn't moisturize a whole lot either. Don't recommend! If you are thinking of purchasing this, at least smell it in-store before you buy it.	negatif
444	4932073	stinky but has great hold - it the sprayer works. Love the hold, hate the smell (reminds me of Aqua Net from the 80's - and lasts for days) and the can clogs regularly. Between the awful smell and the can clogging (even with regular rinsing and shaking), I had to move on from this product. Bummer because like many of the reviews suggest, the hold is absolutely perfect for fine hair.	negatif
445	18802559	I purchased this a few years ago at Sephora when I found out I was pregnant. It had great reviews but a few people mentioned the awful smell. That should have been enough to steer me away but I took a chance. I am very sensitive to heavily scented products and this was one of the worst I’ve encountered. I couldn’t have handled this on a normal day let alone being pregnant with constant morning sickness. Why in the world would they put so much fragrance in it? I ended up giving it away.	negatif
446	13100209	I bought this product not to long ago after finding some dark spots on my cheeks. Needless to say, the application product was horrible. The serum has a weird color, and an awful smell.

462	803755	I've used Oil of Olay face cream for sensitive skin for more years than I like to admit. Now they've added sun screen and I can no longer use it (I've been able to buy the one without sun screen online up until now). It has a definite scent for hours after applying it. It makes my eyes water. My cheeks are getting red also. And, to top it all off, it is causing a bad taste in my mouth (lipstick and other lotions do this to me also). I have no idea what to use now, their previous product was so perfect for me. Oil of Olay is a good product, too bad everyone thinks they have to make us use sun screen!	negatif

I have no idea what it supposed to smell like but it's like the worst chemically weird smell ever. I almost gagged spraying it. Even after letting it settle down you can still smell it. After removing my makeup, washing, and going through my whole nighttime care routine... I COULD STILL SMELL IT! Seriously it is that bad. Some people might be able to handle it, but it almost has such a chemical smell that it's worrying to put it on your skin. Hard pass.	negatif

I DO NOT recommend for anyone to buy this brand line, the chemical smell is awful, it does not dye your hair, it damages it and worst thing is you are left with bleached hair if I wanted to be blonde I would have done it differently.	negatif
477	1136645	I’m not sure what other people have received but this perfume has either gone bad or is fake. I am so disappointed in this product because the reviews were promising and I was almost out of my old bottle which was purchased from Sephora but they no longer carry it. Shipping took forever but I was ok with it, 60$ for dot is a steal. Even the bottle was broken when I opened it but it was still useable so even that I wrote off. But when I sprayed it, the most aweful sweet chemical smell came out. And what’s more unacceptable it irritated the skin on my wrists where I sprayed it. Nothing some warm water and soap didn’t fix but it only added to the disappointment. Will be contacting seller to return	negatif
478	966926	I truly have never left a product review before - the new formula is nauseating. Loved the original formula, used it as my shave cream and face cleanser. I can't stand the new formula, has a very strong chemical smell. The original formula was scentless. Though I grabbed the wrong thing first time I used it and saw the ew formula badge. Seriously disappointed - grabbed shave cream and threw this in the trash first chance I got.Neautrogena - men are not used to lathering smelly thungs on their body like women - we are not used to strong scented things. Please go back to the original formula or offer both versions at least.	negatif
479	15244053	I can't even sugar coat this one. This is one of the worst mascaras I have ever tried. I have short, sparse lashes and I loved the Perversion mascara. First off, as soon as I opened it, I noticed a chemical smell coming off of it. It was awful! It also did almost NOTHING for my lashes. Maybe a little length but no volume. It also didn't separate my lashes. The bristles are kind of poky too, so if you have sensitive eyes, be aware. It's not as bad as they're real, but still poky. I didn't try the sex proof part. Honestly, if my husband got a whiff of my lashes, I wouldn't have a shot anyway.	negatif
480	8186125	I don't know what Urban Decay uses to make these lip glosses but they smell like straight paint thinner! It's disgusting.My gloss came in the Naked On the Run Palette and at first I thought maybe it was just from a bad batch. A few days later at work I decided to smell every single tester we had of this gloss and they were all the same -- super strong chemical smell. It is definitely nothing something I'd want to put on my face, especially not my lips where the chance of me ingesting some is possible.I would NEVER purchase one of these glosses unless UD changes the formula completely!	negatif
481	18459814	for all Elixir lovers, this perfume has been changed, I was so disappointed with my purchase, after using this for over 30 years and loving it, i expected the same with this purchase, at first i thought I had been given a replica perfume, but on researching the Clinique pages online, i find many others all saying the same, the formula has been changed, for the worse in my opinion, it has no staying power and in my case, leaves a nasty chemical smell on my skin, hard earned money totally wasted!! cannot return as it has been opened,0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product link	negatif
482	23023701	UGH! The stench! Think of the sharp, acrid chemical smell of cheap clothes detergent and you've got the smell of Clarins. Why does Clarins ruin a creme with such a horrible stink? The smell gives me a headache and if you are the kind of person that recoils at synthetic perfume smells you should avoid this creme. Now let me describe the cremes quality in regards to hydrating the skin. I always put creme on my hands at bedtime. If I wake up with parched hands I know the creme is not for me. With Clarins I woke up with taunt, parched skin. I am giving my tube to a girlfriend who might even pass it on to her girlfriend...who knows?	negatif
483	25782164	Orange to Soapy I absolutely loved the Clementine sample so I eagerly gave Orange Sanguine a try. On my skin, this goes from a strong orange to Zest bath soap (“You’re not clean unless you’re zestfully clean!”). I can’t understand why some reviewers think it smells like Clorox wipes- there’s no pungent alcohol or chemical smell. It does smell a bit masculine, possibly due to the sandalwood. I didn’t detect the jasmine and geranium notes at all. If you’re looking for a great citrus scent, check out Atelier’s Clementine California.	negatif
484	5415080	First off, when I opened this jar, I was overwhelmed by the chemical smell, I think it's meant to smell like Jasmine but it is really strong and offputting. It's not something I would like on my face for 10 minutes.When I put this on, there was a little bit of stinging in my sensitive areas such as my chin and my forehead, the smell was really distracting and I couldn't relax because of it. It hardened to a clay which I didn't find too uncomfortable and it was to be expected. When I washed it off, I noticed no added radiance or refining of pores. I have used this weekly for a month and have no noticed no difference. Will be sticking with my lush masks in future.	negatif
485	19371305	I suspect this is a fake product. Have been using Garnier Micellar Water for 2 years now and swear by it. Bought online as convenient and cheap. However on arrival I compared the smell of the Amazon product with my almost finished bottle from Boots - the one from Boots is almost odourless and I've never noticed a smell when using it over the years. The product from Amazon, however, has a very strong, harsh chemical smell. While the label states the product should be perfume free and both bottles have the same ingredients listed... something doesn't add up. Will not buy this from Amazon again unfortunately.	negatif
486	14382005	Never again!!!! This mascara is probably the most under performing I have ever paid for. It is affordable in price. But, it did absolutely nothing for my lashes! I liked the design of the brush and I thought it would have actually curled and lengthened my lashes, it did not. Then, it has this weird chemical smell that I cannot describe. Every time I opened this tube, it made me nauseous. I apply 2 coats to my upper and lower lashes and all it did was clump. Lastly, this formula is DIFFICULT to remove. I have had to use witch hazel, my regular eye makeup remover repeatedly in one sitting to remove it all. I would never use this again nor recommend it!	negatif
487	6016369	"I bought a light pastel pink called ""Chic"" 563A. It is truly a beautiful color, peachy pink with a tad but of shimmer. The color is about all there is. The product has a strange chemical smell and a horrid taste, like you ate a glob of sunscreen. No staying power, and bleeds off on anything you touch. After wearing it, my lips turn into a flaky, peeling mess. Very disappointed, only cost me $3.25, but for $2 Wet N Wild makes much better quality cheap lipstick. I've been disappointed by NYX in everything I have purchased. Abandoning this brand for good."	negatif
488	17995645	The first time I tried this powder I used it to set under my eyes. To begin with everything looked great and I liked the fact it didn’t look cakey. However, I then took a photo with my flash and I looked like a ghost! IT HAS THE WORST FLASHBACK! Do NOT bake with this powder! You have to be really sparing when you use this, you can get away with a very light dusting under the eyes but even then there’s a chance of flashback. Oh and it has a strong chemical smell, deffo avoid inhaling this!	negatif
489	11088408	I really wanted to try a cleansing conditioner after so many of you posted in that you don't use a shampoo....but help me find one that isn't AWFUL!!!I applied and was not liking the smell.

490	19977643	I was so excited to try this because i have super wavy and frizzy recently dyed hair. The first thing I noticed was the scent. I didn't find it to be very pleasant. It smelled heavily of plastic, almost a chemical smell, very similar to the scent of cheap hotel soap and shampoo. It had a decent lather and did not strip any color from my hair which was great, but after rinsing, my hair felt very dry and there was an alarming amount of fallout, much more than the strand of hair or two that im used too. I'm not impressed and probably won't use this ever again. I'm giving it one star only because it did not strip any color from my hait.	negatif
491	22434145	This is not the original mousse that was amazing for curls. About 15 years ago Pantene made a mousse in this exact same bottle (white and pink) and it was INCREDIBLE. Perfect hold, no crunch... and the scent was amazing. I got so many compliments. This is an imposter... they have clearly switched the formula to make it cheaper. It has a chemical smell, is too thick and heavy and leaves my curls crunchy and weighed down. When I posted about it on another website they denied changing the formula... I’m sorry but I know they have. It was so good before and it’s so bad now. It’s not even cheap!	negatif
492	1437786	Firstly when I sprayed it on my roots it freeze burnt my head slightly and put me in mind of when I had a wart frozen at the GP! Considering I had the lightest blonde shade, it was fairly dark browny gold and vastly different to my light blonde hair, in fact it was such a miss match I had to wash it off immediately as it would have looked odd. It also has a fairly chemical smell which I found unpleasant and it was stiff and tacky to the touch on my hair. Unless they changed the colours and the smell and texture I wouldn't recommend it at this stage, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
493	18461377	I don't usually post negative reviews but I was massively disappointed when I received this. The original Lolita lempicka was a favourite of mine and over the years I have had over 20 bottles at least . this is clearly a re-formulated version and it is weaker and the body of the fragrance is not the same, whilst the notes are there on the dry down , it has a more chemical smell initially and it doesn't project at all. With the original I used to get comments that I could be smelt throughout the building. now I can barely smell this myself.

494	4859828	slimy, drying, chemical smell. I can't figure out why this product is award-winning. It smells like a myriad of chemicals, and it dries out my skin. It feels slimy when I put it on, and it doesn't lather much. It doesn't exfoliate, and it did nothing for my acne, despite morning and night use for 2 weeks straight. The only positive thing I can say about it is, it got my skin clean. But if I only wanted to get my skin clean, I can spend a few dollars to buy bar soap. This product is not worth the price paid.	negatif
495	4726537	smells funny, sheer coverage. I ordered this as soon as I could. I shook it up, like the instructions said, and the consistency is pretty liquidity. I bought the shade light, I'm light medium skin tone with yellow undertones and pink overtones, which is neutral. It is pretty thin coverage, I had to go over With my Nara creamy concealer to get coverage. The applicator is super big, be careful you can easily get too much product in one dot of application. The worst part is the chemical smell. It smells like paint or paint thinner to me. So I gave it one star for the pretty packaging, this baby is getting returned.	negatif
496	25332027	wanted to love it, but it’s not for me Sadly, had to remove this from my loves :( I love Kat Von D liquid lipsticks and will continue to buy those but the foundation is not working for me. The color is a good match, but the foundation leaves streaks, looks cakey, dries out my already dry skin like the Sahara dessert. It also feels uncomfortably sticky and has a chemical smell. You have to set it with a thick layer of powder, which makes it look kinda crusty and dusty. Doesn’t last that long even with a setting spray.	negatif
497	4941987	Like most I was so excited about these split pans. I patiently waited for Flowerchild/CP to be available on the Canadian site and grabbed it as soon as I got the in stock email. It arrived today and - wow - it's terrible. Terrible! The blush is horrible. It's dry, chalky, and even with swatching it a few times it barely showed. Like someone below said, it has a very noticeable chemical smell (don't know if it's the packaging or the actual product). Sadly, I'm to blame for falling into the hype, but I will definitely be returning it. If you got the face palette, you absolutely do not need the split pans. I'm very, very wary of buying anything further from Becca.	negatif
498	19913199	I have sensitive skin and no one told me this would cause my face to feel like it was on fire. I bought the full size jar and based on what I was seeing online I just knew it would help my skin look all radiant and firm like in the YouTube videos...not. I could barely keep it on for more than a couple minutes, my face was red and dry. The chemical smell when I opened the jar should’ve told me not to use it but I still put it on my face. I contacted the store I ordered it from and they just told me to see a Dermatologist. If you have sensitive skin stay away from this product!!!	negatif
499	12956756	"This product is made with Salicylic Acid (like most acne products), an amazing agent against acne and warts, but a skin irritant to those with sensitive and/or dry skin (Me!). The packaging informs users to use the pads twice a day (""AM and PM""), but if any irritation occurs, to stop using altogether or to use on an every-other-day basis. Another issue is the gross, chemical smell it leaves on your skin, and a sticky, unpleasant feeling afterwards. To avoid this issue, I would squeeze the pads out before using to remove some excess liquid (this also created a nasty liquid puddle in the bottom of my container. Ew!) I do not plan to be purchasing them again, and I overall wouldn't recommend it to users who have similar skin to myself."	negatif
500	4738470	I can't get over the smell to even test out if it works. I used it once and that was all I could handle. If you like the smell, you'll prob love it. But to me it was SO strong and smelled like a bad chemical smell covered up with a cheap synthetic perfumey baby powder smell. Gag. I was hoping it would fade but it didn't. Had to wash it out right away. Sniffing their products in store it seems like all their products have this signature scent. So I won't be trying any more of their products.	negatif
501	5156370	Awful, awful, awful. I got this in my Play box last month and decided to give this a try one morning because I was running late for work. I lived to regret it all day. This product has a terrible chemical smell, leaves horrible white powdery residue on dark hair, and left my hair feeling greasy and gross. The smell alone chased me all day and people were asking me what terrible new perfume I was using :( By the end of the day, my hair was so greasy and sticky I could twist it around my fingers, pull it upwards, and it would stay completely stuck upright. This stuff is absolutely horrifying. Would give negative stars if I could.	negatif
502	19516654	Couldn't wait to try this shampoo as my hair is really thin. Even more so since I've had children. I loved the tube design rather than a bottle as it was really easy to hold in the shower and easy to squeeze out. However I am not impressed with the smell of it. The shampoo had a really funny smell. I think it had a slight sick, or chemical smell; I just can't put my finger on what it smells like. But it's certainly not what I'm used to from shampoo as it usually smells fresh, clean and perfumed. Just using the shampoo alone without conditioner it left my hair dry, knotty and lifeless. The smell has really put me off using it, which is a shame.	negatif
503	5887857	I was looking forward to using this as I love anything that smells of coconutI am very disappointed there is no coconut smell whatsoever instead it has an odd chemical smell which smells disgusting on the skin maybe I have just have been sent a very old pot but seriously I cant use it again as it smells so awful, on the plus side which is why I gave it 1 star is it is a very good moisturiser and my skin feels soft but even that's not enough reason to use it as I now smell like an old candle and will have to wash it off, I am annoyed I have wasted my money.	negatif
504	18579918	very disappointed in the quality of this liquid lipstick. if you're sensitive to smells or makeup at all, do yourself a favor and order a different lipstick! I will be returning it pros: pretty and metallic cons: low pigmentation - looks more like a topper or a gloss than a lipsticksmell - tried to be a vanilla smell but resulted in a sugary play dough smell that's really disgustingwear - takes a long time to set (more than the stated 30 s) and does not wear thru drinking or eatingformula - the formula is the most drying I have ever had from a liquid lipstick, I had visibly dry, dead skin I was picking off three hours after application (color wore off after about one hour, some glitter and the chemical smell remained) in addition, my lips were irritated almost immediately after application	negatif
505	24627157	I had a sample of this with my glossier order and found it awful. I sprayed it on my wrists and couldn't deal with the smell that I washed it off a few hours later. To me it smells fresh and clean. But it also has a chemical smell. it's hard to describe but I have a cheap scented candle called linen that smells similar. It is almost remisinist of air fresheners, cleaning products etc. Plus points if you do like the smell it lasts extremely well, stays potent and a little gives a lot of pay off so the bottle should last you a while.	negatif

581	1366397	I've been using this shampoo in conjunction with the quench absolute conditioner and serum for the last week and I'm very disappointed with the results. Apart from the awful scent, my hair feels dry and my scalp is now red and flaky in areas. It is too highly perfumed and doesn't compare with the Dove oil care range I usually use. As this range is specifically for wavy or curly hair and more expensive than my usual Dove hair products, I expected much better results. I won't be continuing to use this shampoo or the other products in the range and I can't recommend them to others. Such a waste of money.	negatif
582	5619711	I love Wen. Have used the Sweet Almond Mint (SAM) for about 8 years and buy the gallons from QVC every year. However, QVC mistakenly sent me a gallon of this instead of my SAM in Dec. The peach scent NEVER washes out, even using a clarifying shampoo. Also, this leaves my fine hair limp and lifeless, unlike SAM, which leaves my hair full. Once I opened the box, I knew it was not my usual scent and, of course, when I called QVC they had no more of the SAM scent in gallons. $200 a gallon and I'm stuck with this awful scent until June! At least QVC did credit $25 for their mistake, but this isn't worth $10 per gallon in my opinion.	negatif

676	4919120	drying, smells like chemicals, low coverage. I tired so hard to like this foundation but this is a horrible product and I took me a while to realize that. First of all this product has a strong chemical scent that makes my entire face stink throughout the day! other people reviewing that this product is scentless is LYING! Second, this product provides little to no coverage at all and if you try to build it up it becomes cakey. Even with only one layer the foundation clings onto dry spots on my skin, no matter how much I moisturize beforehand. I only have a little bit of this foundation left and I can't wait to use it all up because it's very expensive and I don't want my money to go to waste. I can't believe this product has so many good reviews, it's honestly misleading! I would never repurchase or recommend this overpriced useless foundation	negatif
677	5417951	This review is for the product sold now and NOT the vintage scent (AKA when real ingredients were used instead of synthetics). I started wearing this scent in 1980 and loved it...along with the ORIGINAL Poison, Opium and Tuxedo by Ralph Lauren. Sadly, what you purchase now is nothing like the originals; this scent included. If you wore it then and are thinking about buying it now, don't bother as the scent is different and not in a good way. The warmth, the spice, the darkness is gone and replaced by that chemical scent found in the bulk of fragrances available now. It doesn't last, it has that bug spray scent as a base when first sprayed and the dry down is bitter instead of warm. For those who didn't experience the original, you won't understand how amazing this scent (and so many others from back then) was; the rest of us? Just say no to Magie Noire.	negatif
678	17178211	I have dry sensitive skin, not to the extreme though. I heard So many great things about this brand but it's expensive, for me at least, so when I saw this for half off I immediately grabbed it. First off, the formula is very thin for Claiming it to be for dry skin. It feels very light and cheap (like $1 lotion from dollar tree). It does not have any floral or sweet scent, it has a scent but it's somewhat of a faint chemical scent. After applying the product on my arms and legs it felt nice but I needed a lot, it dried very quickly and a couple minutes after applying, my skin felt extremely dry. I never felt my skin feel that dry. I decided to try it again but the second time I compared it to my A thousand wishes body lotion by Bath & Body Works. The same thing happened with the CeraVe lotion so now I'll be using my Bath & Body Works body lotion until I find a replacement for the CeraVe lotion. Personally I do not recommend this product unless you have normal skin. Its very pricey for a product that doesn't work.	negatif
679	1134676	This cream does as promised, but boy, it really stinks!!! I have used Shea butter before and this is definitely NO its smell. If you are having morning sickness, stay away from this stinky product; otherwise ignore the smell and enjoy the benefits of this cream. I personally use it only once or twice a week because it is pretty stinky and greasy. I do see the effects right away, but they are not worth the awful smell. Not sure if this is a ironical Burt’s Bee Product as I have not been able to find find it any store.	negatif

681	26262840	either a fake or terrible foundation- i bought this with high hopes after reading up online for a foundation that stays put all day. i followed the color chart and ordered cool bone. i am so disappointed and wish i hadnt wasted money on this awful product. i always use a good primer so i put it on over that and it looked like a patchy orange mess. it doesnt even look like im wearing foundation at all it doesnt cover anything it just makes you look a dull orange. it has an awful smell and seems like a really cheap immitation, it dries instantly on your skin so wherever you put it on first it clings to. im so annoyed iv tried it once and wont use it ever again its horrible. amazon should be careful selling fake products. feeling so ripped off!	negatif
682	6013609	I wanted to like this but could not get past the awful smell. Ugh, it's seriously that bad. I tried to get past and just hold my breath. Then I just tossed it in the trash bin. It was inexpensive so I didn't feel too bad. But still, it really needs to be addressed. It could be a great product. I've heard others complain about the same issue so I know it was not just a bad bottle. I'll move on to the Sally Beauty Supply Spray and Stay. It's been great!	negatif
683	5187097	dehydrating, uneven, unflattering. I have been a member at Sephora for years and this is the first time I'm writing a review, because of how terrible this product is. Even after using two moisturizers and a gel based primer this product clung to my skin and gave me imperfections that I don't even have. I'm only 17 years old and this product gave me the appearance of wrinkles all over my face. It is EXTREMELY unflattering, doesn't build well, and has an awful smell. Don't buy this product.	negatif
684	4868049	I wanted to LOVE this palette. I'm not a huge Jaclyn Hill fan but I wanted to support a YouTuber who's rarely steered her followers wrong. Unfortunately, this is no bueno. Am I the only one that noticed the god awful smell? I thought perhaps I got a defective one. I tried to use the shadows with little payoff and even more fallout. I came to read the reviews and I'm so sad to see I'm not the only one disappointed. I have no problem spending money on a palette I'll use. Unfortunately, this is headed back to the store.	negatif
685	5156684	I love Bulgari The Rouge, Vert and Blanc. I was going to reorder The Rouge when I discovered a new fragrance The Noir. I couldn't wait to try it. However, this is nothing like the others. All I can say is it is extremely strong and odd. Perhaps its the Oud, which I read about but have never smelled before.My husband came in the room and said what is that awful smell. Recently he commented how much he liked when i wore La Vie est Belle ! I had to.wash my hands. Unfortunately this will be the first Sephora product I ever returned.	negatif
686	24095195	I can't believe I'm giving this 1 star because I try to give every product a fair shot, but I just could not bring myself to like this powder.  First, it had an AWFUL smell.  I'm talking dead fish smell.  I don't know if I got an old powder or what, but it was unbearable.  I applied the powder anyway and the powder was so chalky and made my skin look horrible and blotchy.  It was so bad that I had to wipe my makeup off and start over.  I would pass on this powder.   	negatif
687	1545064	I am quite fair skinned and had high hopes that this would would give me a light golden tan without the awful smell you normally get from tanning products. No strong smell but that is the only good thing I can say about it, after using the whole tube exactly as directed over a period of 8/9 days there was absolutely no tan what so ever. Having seen that there are others who have had the same problem with the St Tropez in shower gradual tan I can only conclude that for some of us our own personal chemical' make up makes it impossible for this to take on our skin. Complete waste of money.	negatif
688	23643757	First off, I can't get past the horrible smell this foundation has (my husband asked me what the awful smell on my face was) and was not happy that its bottled in plastic not glass. For me this was more of a sheer foundation, not medium to full coverage and this is not buildable. After three applications, it was the exact same as the first application. The consistency is on the thinner side and even after shaking really good. This is definitely NOT worth all the hype!!! I was expecting such a great quality of foundation and that was quite the opposite!! Terribly disappointed and will never wear or purchase this again!!!	negatif

705	768963	This makeup was awful and I mean awful. The smell was not good and when I squeezed it out what I got was water so I shook it up and still got water at first and then some makeup came out. I would not recommend this at all. I will stick with the Chanel Healthy glow, that is a wonderful makeup and it is makes your face just look like a smooth canvas.	negatif
706	1085222	Awful, strong smell!! And greasy and thick. Because of strong perfume smell, could not stand it on my face near my nose and was still strong wafting up from my neck. I was really hoping this would work, especially since it even said it was Amazon's choice. I might be willing to try it again if L'Oreal put out a fragrance free version.	negatif
707	13661757	This product is awful. The smell although pleasant reminds me so much of shampoo or conditioner. Plus it's so strong. With a string fragrance added you know it's not good for your skin. My skin broke out which it never does normally so that's no good. If anything it made me skin peel. It's too expensive and there are so many better alternatives.	negatif
708	17222940	I don’t know what it is about this lipstick but it’s awful. The smell is nasty, I hate the flimsy cardboard tube and the color hardly has any pigment (what little color there is isn’t what I expected from the lipstick). They don’t last either. It sat on top of my lips and created this weird film on them. Definitely will not repurchase.	negatif
709	3098237	Not for me, I have used alot of Tigi products but this one is awful, no smell and it doesn't matter how small an amount I use , it doesn't wash out,my hair feels very greasy afterwards, gutted after spending the money...I would like a refund but there is no way of contacting the seller...	negatif

711	5189951	greasy, oily feeling. I really wanted to like this foundation, I had recently been in need of something for my combo skin, and read a lot of good things about Make Up Forever.. I had a Sephora consultant direct me to this line since I had told her about the type of lightweight feeling I wanted. She color matched me, and... she was matching the colors to my neck. which was definitely wrong. This foundation is SO watery. I found it to basically melt right off my face by hour 5. It did not cover up any blemishes whatsoever. It smells like bad perfume and I ended up looking like a greasy mess. Don't waste your money.	negatif
712	5149982	I do not get the hype for this product at all. Its formula is SUPER thick and it's easy to go overboard with it. It has an awful lemon scent and a really bad selection of colors. Very hard to match. I did end up using the entire product to not waste it. DO NOT use this foundation with anything (primer, moisturizer) underneath it. When I did that, my normally very dry skin became so oily that the foundation felt like it would slide off. It works MUCH better on its own.	negatif
713	6178193	I didn't get this in this particular package, I got it with this package deal. It's just awful. The scent just smalls like plastic, the consistency feels like a silicone primer and it pills up really bad on my hands! By pilling I mean that if I rub my hands together, touch something, etc, the product gathers in little tubes all over my hands. It leaves residue when I touch other things. I've only used it three times and I had to wash my hands directly afterward because of it. Definitely do NOT recommend	negatif
714	910570	Bad Smell,Ineffective,Irritates Skin Awful product. I have acne that is most likely genetic, but this made it even worse. Dried out my skin at the same time that I was breaking out. If you read the ingredients it is full of harmful chemicals. Even smells artificial as well. Do not buy if you have sensitive skin.	negatif
715	1425737	This product smelled like bad smelling talc in my hair. One of the ingredients is: fragrance. I am not typically allergic to perfume but this bad smell has made me cough nonstop until I finally washed it out. This type of an unnatural fragrance is not typically found in a mostly natural product, they need to quit using this awful fragrance.	negatif
716	1323237	Absorbs Quickly,Goes On Smoothly,Not Greasy Bad Smell,Not Long-Lasting I bought this because I was out of my Urban Decay moisturizer and wanted to save a couple bucks.

717	586932	Bad smell,Gritty,Messy,Unnatural Color This was horrible. The powder smells like motor oil. It's so fine that you breathe it in while applying.

720	1256781	Bad Smell I don't know if I just got an expired / bad product or if it is supposed to smell bad. I received this this brand and scent of body butter a few years back. I loved the smell of it. So when I saw it at Ulta, I ordered more. Well, what I received smelled nothing like it did a few years ago. I threw it away.	negatif
721	1619852	Bad Smell,Causes Breakouts,Ineffective I got it for my birthday and almost couldn't even use it because of the odor. It smells like coconut but has a hint of factory mixed in.

725	5241586	sticky, bad smell, liquidy. This was not at all what I would expect from a primer, instead of the smooth application I would usually get from a smashbox primer, this primer left my face super sticky. This did not allow smooth application of my foundation and instead made a streaky mess. On top of that it has the smell of expired coconut tanning oil.	negatif
726	8233549	This product did not work for me. I did not see much of a difference once I applied the product to my lips. It was just another lip gloss with a tingling sensation and bad smell. i have very sensitive lips, and i am not a fan of the burning feeling I had about 1-2 minutes after I applied the plumber. Will not buy again. Sorry Too Faced. :(	negatif
727	18626392	Absolutely shocked about the good reviews for this product. I have never used a sunblock that was worse than this. Thick, hard to spread, bad smell and so, so white. I looked like ghost face and had to wipe it off. A friend tried it and asked why on earth I didn't just toss this.	negatif
728	19489035	I loved the old Rosemary and Juniper formula. In many ways it was my holy grail shampoo. It had a subtle, but fresh smell and it really made my thick hair bouncy with more volume. It was perfect. The new formulation has too much of a smell (a bad smell at that) and it makes my hair flat. Not an improvement at all. Please go back to the old formula.	negatif
729	3306421	Really bad smell. Smells very strongly like an old pencil case with pencil shavings all in the bottom. The smell lingers about the face too, I cthink uld smell it wafting about my face and if anyone kissed me they would definitely have smelt it. Couldn't wait to wash it off, I had to wash the blusher brush too! :(Disappointed.	negatif
730	4813618	bad smell, tangled hair. I hated this shampoo and conditioner and the spray. UGH! The smell was like an old man's cologne. It choked me throughout the day. I used it a few days before I couldn't take the smell anymore. And my thin, fine hair was a tangled mess. Horrible.	negatif
731	22662980	don’t bother honestly no redeeming qualities to this product. i was really let down. thankfully i only had the DS size. not hydrating at all, my skin felt very dry and gross after using. not a bad smell per se but not pleasant at all. barely highlighting either... left a weird white streaky look on face and shimmery only on hands. impossible to remove from hands either.	negatif

I had to use the entire sample packet to clean the sponge, and that seems like a lot.	negatif
734	16350544	I has bought the Sephora Supreme Body Butter very excitedly. I love the concept of body butters but was particularly disappointed with this product. Even though it moisturizes and nourishes my skin, i just could not ignore the bad smell of the product. it smells clinical and medicine- like. Not good at all. I discontinued using the product after the first three days and the jars is still lying almost full.	negatif
735	4989180	bad smell, smelly. I was so excited to try this product thinking it was going to smell as beachy as it's name. Instead I found it smelled like a frumpy grandma. I put it in my dry hair and it was fairly sticky and didn't add any volume. I wouldn't purchase a full size just based on the smell though.	negatif
736	18285304	I feel bad for saying that I don’t like these products but it’s true. They suck and id rather die than use them lol. They smell awful and they don’t last long at all. I think they need to be recalled	negatif

740	10581985	Despise this product. It makes my child's hair greasy, heavy and smell awful after she's had it on for awhile. She has long hair, medium curls. It leaves her hair so heavy she complains it hurts and wants to cut it off. Started using suave and she is so much happier.	negatif
741	9369665	Did not care for this product at all. Just the smell a lone was awful. I know smell shouldn't matter and I my just have a high sensitivity to smells but it turned me off. Also wasn't to fussy about the applicator.	negatif
742	16800240	Makes you smell awful after about an hour! I’m not sure if they changed the formula because of all the great reviews a few years ago. I don’t usually sweat much, but this made me smell like BO worse than if I would wear nothing at all!	negatif
743	10848873	These smell awful I bought as a gift for my sis in law a while back and wanted to smell them before gifting to her. They were sold as a set of 4 for less than the price of one.

744	15223301	Awful!!! I have used their full size matte lipsticks before and they were AMAZING. I was so excited to try these and they disappointed. Do not waste your money on these. Super watery, smell awful and far from matte. These were like cheap lipgloss from the store.	negatif
745	15947509	This product just wasn't for me. It was greasy and unpleasant. I did not like the lingering scent and odd residue. It was a decent product, just not for me.	negatif
746	8130827	I do not like this. the scent is weird and it tastes horrible. it doesn't moisturizer at all. also maybelline is not cruelty free. I do not recommend.	negatif

748	1289274	I should have known better, but I took a chance in buying this Youth Dew, and now I regret it. The fragrance I received is either fake, has been reformulated, or the bottle has been in storage for several decades, because girls, this is NOT the Youth Dew I used to wear, love, and for which I received compliments. The first time I wore it (I spray lightly in the air and walk in to it), I noticed a pungent chemical smell. What the heck?! Then when my husband came home and we kissed hello, he wrinkled his nose and asked if I'd been chewing tobacco! (I don't chew tobacco - nor smoke it.) Undeterred, I wore it again the next day, and once again, got a top note of a sickening sweet chemical/tobacco smell. I have stubbornly worn it several times - hoping it would eventually smell better when the initial spray wore off, but my dear, sweet husband, who never criticizes anything, finally told me he did not like my new fragrance and that I smelled like his grandmother. Very disappointing, but you get what you pay for.	negatif
749	5088097	wears off easy, chemical smell, poor quality. I would like to say I don't mind the small packaging, even though I thought it was going to be a little bit bigger. I do mind that it is plastic unlike the original. I think that was just a way for Too Faced to cut costs. Also the formula is not the same as the original, you can read the ingredients and see that for yourself. The mattes are very chalky and blend away so easy. The other shades have no pigment at all just tons of glitter. The glitter also falls all over the palette and all on my face, even with a glitter primer. Something that i noticed right away when putting it on my eyes was how fast the shadows started to crease on my eyes and how it didn't have the same chocolate smell. I've always been a fan of Too Faced, but after putting this product out I'm questioning whether I will purchase anything from them again anytime soon.	negatif
750	15518655	"The name made me laugh- apparently we have gone throught the BBs and CCs, now we are on E haha! Also, lol at the OUTrageous claims here my friends.This product is not suitable for oily skin. It dries down looking very reflective and moist. It does fill in the pores somewhat when pressed into the skin, but the moist look takes away from that. It covers acne scars fairly well, but not dark spots. This is also difficult to blend with your fingers. As you blend it in the product becomes darker and more orange. It really clings to baby hairs on the face. As I blended, the chemical smell also became stronger. It is very thin and liquid-y. It blends in very patchy. If you have fair/porcelain skin this is definitely not the best for you- it is so orange! It really gives a warm but orange cast to my fair skin. It says ""high level spf 30"" ...what? That is not a high spf that is a basic, low to maybe middle range coverage. "	negatif
751	13220731	Had a terrible experience with this product! I use garnier products in my every day skin care routine and was quite excited when I seen this advertised. I opened it and my first impression was the horrible chemical smell from the mask. The application method I would quite odd too. After applying the mask and wearing it for the stated time, I rinsed my face and applied my usual moisturiser. Within the hour my skin had can put in a rash with massive dry blotches. It resulted in a trip to the doctors for a steroid cream as I had such a bad reaction. For the next week my face looked and felt awful and was very painful. I've got my own business and also do hours in a spa where make-up is a must, and felt like I was setting a bad example to my clients .	negatif
752	24960783	I got this 5 months ago and I haven't really noticed much of a difference. It moisturises I guess (? I have oily combo skin) but I don't really like the chemical smell, sort of like strong sunscreen. My biggest issue with this is, that it causes pilling! Not cool. So instead of being able to use the amount that I want, I have to really make sure I put only a very thin layer, if that. Then I'm not sure if that gives me the sun protection I need. I guess spf10 isn't much to begin with anyway. To be honest I'm just using it to justify the amount of money I paid for it but I actually really hate putting it on my face. I can't even see how much I've got left cos the bottle is opaque! Really disappointed as I thought i would like this product.	negatif
753	15719317	I recieved this product to try for free from L'Oreal and I was extremely disappointed. I have dyed hair so I was excited to try their first ever hair line free of sulphites and chemicals that are harsh on dyed hair. I was so disappointed. First off, it is way overpriced. I found it in the store for $10.99. The bottle was small AND when applying in the shower you need way more product then normal. I used probably double what I normally use. Once on my hair I constantly had to apply water to work up any sort of lather. The smell was okay (I've never heard of Indian lilac before) but it almost had a slight chemical smell that I couldn't help but notice. I let my hair air dry and awaited the results. I found my hair to be more greasy than usual in which I can normally go a few days without taking a shower. But this was not the case. I ended up having to shower the very next day. I would not recommend this new line of hair products from L'Oreal as you don't get a bang for your buck. 	negatif
754	17733737	"I received a Vox Box from Influenster for L'Oreal Paris Arginine Resist x3. The box was filled with 3 full sized products (shampoo, conditioner, and a reinforcing leave in spray) as well as coupons for $2 when you purchase 2 products. The products in this line are targeted to ""fragile hair with tendency to fall"". The products claim to ""reinforce hair making hair stronger"". <br /><br />The packaging is attractive, black and pink, but nothing outstanding or remarkable. The reinforcing spray was easy to use, although I wonder if the nozzle will "" gum up"" over time. <br /><br />I wasn't overly fond of the scent of the shampoo or conditioner, I found it had a slight chemical smell. I also found the shampoo didn't lather as well as I had expected. <br /><br />As my hair (air) dried, I noticed it was becoming very ""straw-like"" and dry. It also tangled so badly, I had to deep condition my hair to get all of the knots out. <br /><br />Final verdict? I think I'll need to give it a second try, but overall I wasn't impressed and doubt I will switch from my normal brand."	negatif
755	6208938	I got a sample of this, and was excited to try it out, because who doesn't love masks, right? I opened it up, and noticed a really weird smell, like an overtly chemical smell. When it came to the application, this mask was very clumpy. There were clumps of it all over my face and it started clumping even more while being applied. This product dries ultra fast, less than a minute for me, which made it difficult to work with. Overall, this mask was gross in appearance and consistency. It dried out my skin severely, with it being on less than the recommended 5 minutes. My skin felt tight, but not in a good way. Tight, like all the moisture in my skin was stripped. It felt chalky, not smooth. This made my skin feel itchy, and I have never had sensitive skin so that isn't the issue. It's just not a good product.	negatif
756	4819034	What set me off at first was the chemical smell to it. Smells like paint thinner or nail polish remover. There's no way that's good for the skin. It slid all over my face even after setting it with their setting powder. It was so wet I couldn't get anything else to set it other then that. Both this and their foundation made my face appear very oily not a Demi matte look they claimed. The color was beautiful and exact match to my skin not yellow not pink a very natural color. Both this and the foundation wouldn't last for longer then 4-5 hours. It creased under my eye in less than 2 hours. Clinged to my dry patches slid around on my normal parts of skin. I have combination skin where my nose is my dryest area and the rest of my t zone is normal and the outer rim of my face is a touch dryer. So not oily skin at all. Very disappointed considering their other foundation products are amazing. This isn't something I'd recommend to any of my friends/family.	negatif
757	24677150	Not Worth Your Hard Earned Money horrible product looked orange on my skin tone . it had a horrible chemical smell and didnt tan overtime , it went on orange (dirty orange ) and stained that way ! The most disappointing thing is that I ordered this twice because the first shipment I got both mouse and this oil the mouse spilled out in the box and this oil was expired ! it said 4/18 when ordered it the second week of April. so o called sephora they sent out another mouse and oil the same thing happened the mouse spilled out and was not dark but pumped out a green color and this oil was yet again expired but this time it said 3/18 and it was already pushing mid April! and both shipments didnt include the free tanning Mitt that the mouse comes with ! will never spend money on this expensive product again I'm going with loving tan , they've never disappointed and works like I want it to !	negatif
758	24760483	I got this because it reminds me of the clarins lip balm. Packaging it great and feels fancy., more fancy than clarins. Also it has spf! I thought it would be great for summer use since it's starting to get warmer now! (Well it is good for all year around since there is sun all year around lol) BUT WHAT I ABSOLUTELY DISAPPROVE is it doesn't moisturize well (I guess it should be fine if it is to be used in the summer) and IT MADE MY LIPS PEEL! I have never had this issue with lip balms with spf until this came along. Could be a weird reaction but it definitely scared me a lot. Definitely not worth the $22.. and it doesn't have the heavenly scent clarins lip balm has rather it has a chemical smell to it. A huge skip for me.	negatif
759	19542541	I used the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Core Restore Conditioner after the shampoo. Its a clear gel like conditioner and has a bit of a chemical smell to it, which was a bit off putting. I massaged it in to my hair, then rinsed, it took a few more rinses than I normal have to do for it to feel like it was all out. I towel dried my hair then tried to comb it. I couldnt get my comb throught it. I felt sticky and all tangled. After about 10 painful minutes I had managed to comb my hair. I then started to blow dry it. Once I had dried my hair it did have more volume than normal, but it felt sticky and really dry. There was no shine to it it just looked dull. Will try it again incase it gets better the more I use, but first impressions are very disappointing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
760	19542647	Having tried and loved the volumising shampoo I was eager to try the Protein Infused Clear Conditioner. The first thing I noticed was the strong chemical smell. This didn't put me off though. It is of a thick consistancy and spreaded over my hair very well. I left it on for a few minutes and rinsed as normal. I was so disappointed as my hair felt more dry then it did before I put it on. Not one to be beaten I put more on and wrapped my hair in a warm towel and left it for 20 minutes. Crunch time.....once I rinsed it again it still didn't feel any better and felt very dry on the ends. So in the end I had to admit defeat and use an alternative conditioner to soften my hair. I wouldn't use the conditioner again thats for sure. If I could award it 0 stars I would. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]	negatif
761	19515898	I think the John Frieda Luxurious Volume Core Restore shampoo simply doesn't live up to the hype. I was so excited to try a product that claimed to be able to add volume to my fine hair. If I was rating the volume it gives it would be a 4 out of 10. I have used this shampoo for over two weeks to give it the best possible chance. Pros Gives a small amount of volume Cons Smells vile, very chemical smell to it My hair simply does not feel clean after using this shampoo Causes my scalp to itch on the second day so end up having to wash my hair everyday. My hair still doesn't hold the style Hair frizzes something terrible with damp conditions Don't waste your money it just doesn't live up to the hype.

762	19516659	I had high hopes for this range as I had noticed that the longer my hair gets the limper is seems to fall. I do not like to leave negative reviews so I will begin with what this product does achieve and that is that it does certainly clean the hair throughly of all previous products, and it looks like more volume of hair afterwards. However, my hair felt dried out & rough and smelled awful as this product has an umpleasant chemical smell. Even after conditioning the shine did not return, it was very difficult to brush without causing damage and really felt like a complete nightmare. The hair was certainly volumised but the effect was a total frizz ball. I gave this to my sister to try out and she reported the same, with hairs condition being effected even after using a conditioning treatment it took 3 washes for prior shine to return. This product effectively stripped all healthy oils from hair.	negatif
763	5012057	As far as sheet masks go, this one can be skipped. It comes soaked in product which is great and the mask it self is very soft but that's as far as it goes. The actual product on the mask has a strange smell to it a perfume but yet chemical smell that I couldn't place and wasn't a fan of. While having the mask on it made my skin feel slightly irritated (I would call my skin far from sensitive on a good day). This didn't really do any of the things it promised, i.e. shrinking pores etc. After I removed the mask I had so much product left over on my skin it would not absorb so I had to towel some of it off. It left my skin feeling sticky. Will not use again, nor would I recommend this to anyone.	negatif
